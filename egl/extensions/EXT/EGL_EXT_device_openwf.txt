Status

    Complete

Version

    Version 4 - August 22, 2014

Number

    EGL Extension #80

Extension Type

    EGL device extension for EGL_EXT_device_openwf

    EGL display extension for EGL_EXT_output_openwf

Dependencies

    EGL_EXT_device_openwf requires EGL_EXT_device_base.

    EGL_EXT_output_openwf requires EGL_EXT_output_base.

    Both require OpenWF Display

    An EGLDisplay supporting EGL_EXT_output_openwf must be associated
    with an EGLDevice supporting EGL_EXT_device_openwf.

Overview

    Increasingly, EGL and its client APIs are being used in place of
    "native" rendering APIs to implement the basic graphics
    functionality of native windowing systems.  This creates demand
    for a method to initialize EGL displays and surfaces directly on
    top of native GPU or device objects rather than native window
    system objects.  The mechanics of enumerating the underlying
    native devices and constructing EGL displays and surfaces from
    them have been solved in various platform and implementation-
    specific ways.  The EGL device family of extensions offers a
    standardized framework for bootstrapping EGL without the use of
    any underlying "native" APIs or functionality.

    These extensions define how to map device and output handles between
    EGL and OpenWF Display. An EGL implementation which provides these
    extensions must have access to sufficient knowledge of the OpenWF
    implementation to be able to perform these mappings. No requirements
    are imposed on how this information is obtained, nor does this
    support have any implications for how EGL devices and outputs are
    implemented. An implementation which supports these extensions may
    support other low level device interfaces, such as DRM/KMS, as well.

New Tokens

    Added by EXT_device_openwf:

        Accepted as the <attribute> parameter of eglQueryDeviceAttribEXT

        EGL_OPENWF_DEVICE_ID_EXT                0x3237

    Added by EXT_output_openwf:

        Accepted in the <attrib_list> of eglGetOutputLayersEXT and as
        the <attribute> parameter of eglQueryOutputLayerAttribEXT

        EGL_OPENWF_PIPELINE_ID_EXT              0x3238

        Accepted in the <attrib_list> of eglGetOutputPortsEXT and as
        the <attribute> parameter of eglQueryOutputPortAttribEXT

        EGL_OPENWF_PORT_ID_EXT                  0x3239

New Behavior for EXT_device_openwf

    EGLDeviceEXTs may be mapped to OpenWF Display devices.

    To obtain a WFD_DEVICE_ID for an EGLDeviceEXT, call
    eglQueryDeviceAtribEXT with <attribute> set to
    EGL_OPENWF_DEVICE_ID_EXT.

New Behavior for EXT_output_openwf

    OpenWF pipeline and port IDs may be used to restrict EGL output
    handle searches and may be queried from EGL output handles.

    Add to Table 3.10.3.1 in EGL_EXT_output_base:

        Attribute                   Type      Access
        --------------------------  -------   ------
        EGL_OPENWF_PIPELINE_ID_EXT  integer   S|R

    Add to Table 3.10.3.2 in EGL_EXT_output_base:

        Attribute                   Type      Access
        --------------------------  -------   ------
        EGL_OPENWF_PORT_ID_EXT      integer   S|R

Issues

    1.  Although the overview says that we do not impose any
        restrictions on how the features are implemented, restrictions
        in the OpenWF specification combined with the chosen interface
        here do implicitly impose limitations. Specifically, the
        wfdCreate* functions can only be called once to obtain OpenWF
        handles. This means that an EGLDevice/Output implementation
        cannot be layered on top of OpenWF without preventing the
        application from calling these functions. So we must assume that
        the implementation instead has some backdoor into OpenWF to
        obtain the object IDs. Possible resolutions include:
        a)  Keep the access model as is. This assumption is a reasonable
            one.
        b)  Flip the requirement. The EGL device/output implementation
            should always create the OpenWF handles itself. We can add
            queries so that the application can get these handles from
            EGL.
        c)  Generalize this extension to support both models. The
            application would have to first query EGL to determine
            whether or not it owns the handles, and then be prepared to
            either query them from EGL or create them itself.
