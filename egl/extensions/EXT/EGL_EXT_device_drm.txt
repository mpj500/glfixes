Status

    Complete

Version

    Version 4 - August 22, 2014

Number

    EGL Extension #79

Extension Type

    EGL device extension for EGL_EXT_device_drm

    EGL display extension for EGL_EXT_output_drm

Dependencies

    EGL_EXT_device_drm requires EGL_EXT_device_base.

    EGL_EXT_device_drm requires a DRM driver.

    EGL_EXT_output_drm requires EGL_EXT_output_base.

    EGL_EXT_output_drm requires a DRM driver which supports KMS.

    An EGLDisplay supporting EGL_EXT_output_drm must be associated
    with an EGLDevice supporting EGL_EXT_device_drm.

Overview

    Increasingly, EGL and its client APIs are being used in place of
    "native" rendering APIs to implement the basic graphics
    functionality of native windowing systems.  This creates demand
    for a method to initialize EGL displays and surfaces directly on
    top of native GPU or device objects rather than native window
    system objects.  The mechanics of enumerating the underlying
    native devices and constructing EGL displays and surfaces from
    them have been solved in various platform and implementation-
    specific ways.  The EGL device family of extensions offers a
    standardized framework for bootstrapping EGL without the use of
    any underlying "native" APIs or functionality.

    These extensions define how to map device and output handles between
    EGL and DRM/KMS. An EGL implementation which provides these
    extensions must have access to sufficient knowledge of the DRM
    implementation to be able to perform these mappings. No requirements
    are imposed on how this information is obtained, nor does this
    support have any implications for how EGL devices and outputs are
    implemented. Among the possibilities, support may be implemented in
    a generic fashion by layering on top of DRM, or EGL and DRM backends
    may be provided by the same vendor and share privileged lower level
    resources. An implementation which supports these extensions may
    support other low level device interfaces, such as OpenWF Display,
    as well.

New Tokens

    Added by EXT_device_drm:

        Accepted as the <name> parameter of eglQueryDeviceStringEXT

        EGL_DRM_DEVICE_FILE_EXT                 0x3233

    Added by EXT_output_drm:

        Accepted in the <attrib_list> of eglGetOutputLayersEXT and as
        the <attribute> parameter of eglQueryOutputLayerAttribEXT

        EGL_DRM_CRTC_EXT                        0x3234
        EGL_DRM_PLANE_EXT                       0x3235

        Accepted in the <attrib_list> of eglGetOutputPortsEXT and as
        the <attribute> parameter of eglQueryOutputPortAttribEXT

        EGL_DRM_CONNECTOR_EXT                   0x3236

New Behavior for EXT_device_drm

    EGLDeviceEXTs may be mapped to DRM device files.

    To obtain a DRM device file for an EGLDeviceEXT, call
    eglQueryDeviceStringEXT with <name> set to EGL_DRM_DEVICE_FILE_EXT.
    The function will return a pointer to a string containing the name
    of the device file (e.g. "/dev/dri/cardN").

New Behavior for EXT_output_drm

    KMS CRTC, plane, and connector IDs may be used to restrict EGL
    output handle searches and may be queried from EGL output handles.

    Add to Table 3.10.3.1 in EGL_EXT_output_base:

        Attribute               Type      Access
        ---------------------   -------   ------
        EGL_DRM_CRTC_EXT        integer   S|R
        EGL_DRM_PLANE_EXT       integer   S|R

    Add to Table 3.10.3.2 in EGL_EXT_output_base:

        Attribute               Type      Access
        ---------------------   -------   ------
        EGL_DRM_CONNECTOR_EXT   integer   S|R

    Add to description of eglOutputLayerAttribEXT:

        If <layer> corresponds to a KMS CRTC and <attribute> is
        EGL_DRM_PLANE_EXT, or if <layer> corresponds to a KMS plane and
        <attribute> is EGL_DRM_CRTC_EXT, an EGL_BAD_MATCH error is
        generated.
