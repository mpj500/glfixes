Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.0 is required.
    
    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.5 Specification.

Overview

    This extension defines a mechanism that enables marking the end 
    of render frames within the OpenGL stream.
    
    When debugging or profiling an OpenGL application, the debuggers
    and profilers needs to know when a render frame is ended. This
    is important for frame per second measurements, statistical analysis, 
    marking and clearing stream loggers logs, performance counters 
    sampling and more.
    
    When an application uses off screen buffers, the debugger / profiler
    cannot be guaranteed that the application will call a certain function at
    the end of each off-screen frame (e.g: SwapBuffers / glClear / etc). 
    This extension enables the application to notify the debugger / profiler 
    whenever a render frame is ended.
    
    This extension is mainly useful for debuggers and profilers. It is not 
    expected that standard drivers would implement this extension. The main
    point of having this extension is to allow applications to have a clean 
    way of accessing this functionality only when they are run under the 
    control of a debugger / profiler, without having to recompile or change 
    the application source code.

Issues

   (1) Should it be legal to call this inside Begin/End?
    
    RESOLVED: no.
    
    A render frame cannot end within a Begin/End block.
