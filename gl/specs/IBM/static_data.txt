Overview

    The OpenGL specification requires that data be bound at call time.	The
    IBM_static_data extension relaxes the bind-at-call semantics allowing
    an implementation to dereference pointers some time after the
    corresponding calls.

    Because of the bind-at-call sematics of standard OpenGL, an
    implementation is required to either copy or fully process data at the
    time it is provided by the application.  Copying data substantially
    increases the demands on the memory subsystem; processing the data may
    result in ineffective amortization of fixed costs.	Neither copying nor
    processing allows multiple rendering threads to operate on the original
    data.

Issues

  * Indirect rendering is ignored; is there anything useful we can do?

  * This specification has been designed to be generic, but at this time
    only allows vertex array data to be noted as static.  Should the
    specification be extended to include data specified in one or more
    of the following ways:
      pixel data [glBitmap, glDrawPixels]
      pixel maps [glPixelMap*]
      vertex data [glVertex*v, glColor*v, glNormal*v, etc.]
      evaluator maps [glMap*]
      texture maps [glTexImage*, glTexSubImage*]
      matrices [glLoadMatrix*, glMultMatrix*]
      other attribute calls [glMaterial*v, glLight*v, etc.]
