Overview

    IBM_rasterpos_clip extends the semantics of the RasterPos functions.  It
    provides an enable that allows a raster position that would normally be
    clipped to be treated as a valid (albeit out-of-viewport) position.

    This extension allows applications to specify geometry-aligned pixel
    primitives that may be partially off-screen.  These primitives are
    tested on a pixel-by-pixel basis without being rejected completely
    because of an invalid raster position.

Issues

    Currently, clipping is disabled only in X and Y.  If disabling Z
    clipping is required, the behavior needs to be specified.
