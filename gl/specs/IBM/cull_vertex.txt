Dependencies

    EXT_cull_vertex affects the definition of this extension

Overview

    IBM_cull_vertex provides a subset of the vertex culling functionality
    found in EXT_cull_vertex without providing a guarantee that faces will
    be culled because of it.  EXT_cull_vertex is a technically superior
    solution, but the vertex culling aspect of IBM_cull_vertex provides
    generally useful function cheaply (without imposing the mandated
    culling found in EXT_cull_vertex).

Issues

  * Should the application be allowed to specify eye direction explicitly,
    as is the case in EXT_cull_vertex?  Not in this specification;
    addressed by the full EXT_cull_vertex extension.

  * Should a control be provided to reverse the eye direction, which would
    be necessary to cull correctly if DepthRange is specified with near >
    far?  Or if the normals specified were reversed?  FrontFace could be
    used in combination with two sided lighting to produce realistic
    lighting effects if the normals were consistenly reversed.  Neither is
    addressed in the current specification.  Both are addressed by
    EXT_cull_vertex. 

  * Should a control be provided to perform vertex culling with a local eye
    position?  Not in this specification; addressed by EXT_cull_vertex.

  * Should forward compatibility between IBM_cull_vertex and
    EXT_cull_vertex be provided (i.e., applications must change if/when we
    fully implement EXT_cull_vertex)?  Probably not.
