Overview

    IBM_texture_mirrored_repeat extends the set of texture wrap modes to
    include a mode (GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT_IBM) that effectively uses a texture
    map twice as large at the original image in which the additional half of
    the new image is a mirror image of the original image.

    This new mode relaxes the need to generate images whose opposite edges
    match by using the original image to generate a matching "mirror image".

Issues

  * The spec clamps the final (u,v) coordinates to the range [0.5, 2^n-0.5].
    This will produce the same effect as trapping a sample of the border texel
    and using the corresponding edge texel.  The choice of technique is purely
    an implementation detail.
