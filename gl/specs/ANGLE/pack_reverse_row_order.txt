Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #110

Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.5 or OpenGL ES 1.0 are required.

    Some of the functionality of this extension is not supported
    when implemented against OpenGL ES.

    EXT_texture_rg interacts with this extension.

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 3.2 Specification
    (Core Profile).

Overview

    This extension introduces a mechanism to allow reversing the order
    in which image rows are written into a pack destination. This
    effectively allows an application to flip the results of a ReadPixels
    in the y direction operation without having to render upside down.

    The coordinate system of OpenGL is vertically reversed in comparison to a
    number of other graphics systems such as native windowing APIs. Applications
    that perform ReadPixels may have to either render to an intermediate color
    buffer before calling ReadPixels or perform a flip in software after
    ReadPixels. In some systems the GL can perform the row reversal during
    ReadPixels without incurring additional cost.
