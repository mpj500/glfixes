    OpenGL ES Extension #112 

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification.

Overview

    In some implementations it is advantageous to know the expected
    usage of a texture before the backing storage for it is allocated.  
    This can help to inform the implementation's choice of format
    and type of memory used for the allocation. If the usage is not
    known in advance, the implementation essentially has to make a 
    guess as to how it will be used.  If it is later proven wrong,
    it may need to perform costly re-allocations and/or reformatting 
    of the texture data, resulting in reduced performance.

    This extension adds a texture usage flag that is specified via
    the TEXTURE_USAGE_ANGLE TexParameter.  This can be used to 
    indicate that the application knows that this texture will be 
    used for rendering.
