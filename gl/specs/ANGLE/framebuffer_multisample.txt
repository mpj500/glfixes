Status

    Implemented in ANGLE ES2

Version

    Last Modified Date: Aug 6, 2010 
    Author Revision: #3

Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #84

Dependencies

    Requires OpenGL ES 2.0.

    Requires GL_ANGLE_framebuffer_blit (or equivalent functionality).

    The extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification. 

    OES_texture_3D affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension extends the framebuffer object framework to
    enable multisample rendering.

    The new operation RenderbufferStorageMultisampleANGLE() allocates
    storage for a renderbuffer object that can be used as a multisample
    buffer.  A multisample render buffer image differs from a
    single-sample render buffer image in that a multisample image has a
    number of SAMPLES that is greater than zero.  No method is provided
    for creating multisample texture images.

    All of the framebuffer-attachable images attached to a framebuffer
    object must have the same number of SAMPLES or else the framebuffer
    object is not "framebuffer complete".  If a framebuffer object with
    multisample attachments is "framebuffer complete", then the
    framebuffer object behaves as if SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one.

    The resolve operation is affected by calling 
    BlitFramebufferANGLE (provided by the ANGLE_framebuffer_blit
    extension) where the source is a multisample application-created
    framebuffer object and the destination is a single-sample
    framebuffer object (either application-created or window-system
    provided).

New Procedures and Functions

    void RenderbufferStorageMultisampleANGLE(
            enum target, sizei samples,
            enum internalformat,
            sizei width, sizei height);

New Types

    None.
