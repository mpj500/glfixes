Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #109

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification.

Overview

    A common use case in GL for some applications is to be able to
    draw the same object, or groups of similar objects that share
    vertex data, primitive count and type, multiple times.  This 
    extension provides a means of accelerating such use cases while 
    restricting the number of API calls, and keeping the amount of 
    duplicate data to a minimum.
    
    This extension introduces an array "divisor" for generic
    vertex array attributes, which when non-zero specifies that the
    attribute is "instanced."  An instanced attribute does not
    advance per-vertex as usual, but rather after every <divisor>
    conceptual draw calls.
    
    (Attributes which aren't instanced are repeated in their entirety
    for every conceptual draw call.)
    
    By specifying transform data in an instanced attribute or series
    of instanced attributes, vertex shaders can, in concert with the 
    instancing draw calls, draw multiple instances of an object with 
    one draw call.
