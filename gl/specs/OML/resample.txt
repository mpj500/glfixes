Dependencies

    OML_subsample is required.
    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification,

Overview

    This extension enhances the resampling capabilities of the
    OML_subsample extension. It is loosely based on the SGIX_resample
    extension.

    When converting data from subsampled to uniform sampling, upsampling
    may be performed by one of three methods: component replication,
    zero fill, or adjacent neighbor averaging.

    When converting data from uniform sampling to subsampled form,
    downsampling may be performed only by component decimation (point
    sampling) or averaging.

    Upsampling and downsampling filters other than those defined by this
    extension may be performed by appropriate use of convolution and
    other pixel transfer operations. The zero fill unpacking mode is
    included to assist applications wanting to define their own filters.

Issues

  * Should RESAMPLE_xxx enums be renamed to PIXEL_RESAMPLE_xxx?
