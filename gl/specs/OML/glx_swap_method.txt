Dependencies

    GLX 1.3 is required.

Overview

    This extension adds a new attribute, GLX_SWAP_METHOD, for a
    GLXFBConfig. The GLX_SWAP_METHOD indicates how front and back
    buffers are swapped when the GLXFBConfig is double-buffered.

IP Status

    No known issues.

Issues and Notes

  * Some hardware supports different swap methods in full screen mode
    vs. windowed mode. How should this be handled? This is not handled
    by this extension. GLX does not support the notion of fullscreen vs.
    windowed mode. A separate extension is required to properly support
    fullscreen mode.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
