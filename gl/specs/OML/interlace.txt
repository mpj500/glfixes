Overview

    This extension provides a way to interlace rows of pixels when
    drawing, reading, or copying pixel rectangles or texture images. In
    this context, interlacing means skiping over rows of pixels or
    texels in the destination. This is useful for dealing with video
    data since a single frame of video is typically composed from two
    images or fields: one image specifying the data for even rows of the
    frame and the other image specifying the data for odd rows of the
    frame.

    The functionality provided by this extension is a combination
    of the older SGIX_interlace and INGR_interlace_read extensions,
    with  changes applying interlacing to texture image queries.

Issues

  * Should there be a single enumerant controlling both draw and read
    operations? For the moment, we continue using separate enums, for
    backwards compatibility with SGIX_interlace and INGR_interlace_read.

  * Can we use the same enum values as the older extensions? Possibly,
    depending on the resolution of issues of exactly which operations
    interlacing is applied to. For the moment we assume the same
    values cannot be used.

  * Are there any GLX protocol issues relating to the actual vs.
    specified size of the image being transferred? Probably not, since
    unlike the effects of convolution, the image being transferred over
    the wire is always the specified size; all that changes is where the
    pixels are positioned in the frame buffer.

  * Discreet requested that INTERLACE_READ_OML apply to GetTexImage. The
    extension does not support this because there's no easy way to
    support it with any generality: with only the binary
    INTERLACE_READ_OML setting available, the implementation could
    return only the even rows, but would have no way of indicating that
    only the odd rows should be returned. This is non-orthogonal
    probably more frustrating than useful; a generic solution would
    require creation of a GetTexSubImage call.

  * We may need to be more precise about exactly which operations
    interlacing is and is not applied to. Currently it must be inferred
    from other parts of the OpenGL Specification, and different
    implementations are likely to disagree on this. Some language has
    been added to section 6.1.4 to deal explicitly with GetTexImage, but
    may be needed elsewhere as well.
