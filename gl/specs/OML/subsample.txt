Overview

    Many video image formats and compression techniques utilize various
    component subsamplings, so it is necessary to provide a mechanism to
    specify the up- and down-sampling of components as pixel data is
    drawn from and read back to the client. Though subsampled components
    are normally associated with the video color space, YCrCb, use of
    subsampling in OpenGL does not imply a specific color space. Color
    space conversion may be performed using other extensions or core
    capabilities such as the color matrix.

    This extension defines two new pixel storage formats representing
    subsampled data on the client. It is loosely based on the
    SGIX_subsample extension, but specifies subsampling with the data
    format parameter rather than pixel packing parameters. It also
    adds support for CYA subsampled data.

    When pixel data is received from the client and an unpacking
    upsampling mode other than PIXEL_SUBSAMPLE_NONE_OML is specified,
    upsampling is performed via replication, unless otherwise specified
    by UNPACK_RESAMPLE_OML.

    Similarly, when pixel data is read back to the client and a packing
    downsampling mode other than PIXEL_SUBSAMPLE_NONE_OML is specified,
    downsampling is performed via simple component decimation (point
    sampling), unless otherwise specified by PACK_RESAMPLE_OML.

Issues

  * Which subsampled component orderings should be supported?

    Only CY and CYA component ordering, since this matches contemporary
    video hardware. YC and YCA ordering will require a separate
    extension defining new formats.

  * The new enumerant naming scheme gives the component frequencies in
    the same order as the components themselves; that is,
    FORMAT_SUBSAMPLE_24_24_OML corresponds to CY 4:2:2, and
    FORMAT_SUBSAMPLE_244_244_OML corresponds to CYA 4:2:2:4. This makes
    naming YC and YCA orderings easier.

  * Should subsampling be specified with new pixel storage parameters,
    like the SGIX_subsample extension, or with new formats, like the
    EXT_422 extension?

    With new formats. There are many invalid format/type combinations
    when specifying subsampling with a pixel storage parameter. Also,
    there's an ambiguity when doing this because the <format> parameter
    represents the after-upsampling data format, not the host format.

  * Because subsampled data is inherently pixel / texture oriented, this
    extension only supports the new formats for pixel and texture
    operations; it does not support them for convolution filters,
    histograms, minmax, or color tables.

  * The only packed pixel type supported is 10_10_10_2, since this is
    needed for video data interoperability. It would be possible to
    support many other packed pixel formats, but most are unused in
    practice.

    Is support for other packed pixels types, particularly
    2_10_10_10_REV, required?

  * Should readbacks of non-even widths be allowed when downsampling?

    No. This is not consistent with draw operations, where this
    constraint already exists. It also makes OML_resample more complex
    when using an AVERAGE filter, since the edge cases may also apply to
    even pixel coordinates. The spec may need to be more explicit about
    this restriction.
