Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required
    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.

Overview


  This extension defines a new mesh primitive.
  The primitive can only be used with vertex arrays and cannot be used in
  immediate mode. The application must arrange the vertices in row major format.
  For example if a quad mesh is 4 vertices wide the, vertices in the first
  row are the first 4 vertices and vertices in the second row are vertices 5
  through 8.

Issues

 1. Should glDrawMultiMeshArraysSUN and/or glDrawRangeMeshArraysSUN
    be included?
   
      No. small meshes are not that common. A mesh is like a series of 
      triangle or quad meshes already. 


New Procedures and Functions

  glDrawMeshArraysSUN( GLenum mode, GLint first, GLsizei count, GLsizei width )
