Overview

    Transparency is done in OpenGL using alpha blending. An alpha value
    of 0.0 is used for fully transparent objects, while an alpha value
    of 1.0 is used for fully opaque objects.  A value of 0.25 is 75%
    transparent, and so on.

    OpenGL defines alpha as a component of the vertex color state.
    Whenever a color is set, the alpha component is set along with the
    red, green, and blue components.  This means that transparency
    can't be changed for primitives with per-vertex colors without
    modifying the color of each vertex, replacing the old alpha
    component with the new alpha component.  This can be very expensive
    for objects that are drawn using vertex arrays; it all but
    precludes the use of display lists.

    This extension defines a new global alpha attribute that can be
    used to specify an alpha factor that is independent from the alpha
    component of the color value.  The global alpha factor is
    multiplied by the fragment's alpha value after primitive
    rasterization and prior to texture mapping, replacing the
    fragment's alpha value.  The global alpha extension is only
    specified in RGBA mode and must be applied prior to any texture
    mapping operation.  It is enabled by a new GLOBAL_ALPHA flag.
