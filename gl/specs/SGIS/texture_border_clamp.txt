Overview

    The base OpenGL provides clamping such that the texture coordinates are
    limited to exactly the range [0,1].  When a texture coordinate is
    clamped using this algorithm, the texture sampling filter straddles the
    edge of the texture image, taking 1/2 its sample values from within the
    texture image, and the other 1/2 from the texture border.  It is
    sometimes desirable for a texture to be clamped to the border color,
    rather than to an average of the border and edge colors.

    This extension defines an additional texture clamping algorithm.
    CLAMP_TO_BORDER_SGIS clamps texture coordinates at all mipmap levels
    such that NEAREST and LINEAR filters return the color of the border
    texels.  When used with FILTER4 filters, the filter operation of
    CLAMP_TO_BORDER_SGIS is defined but doesn't result in a nice
    clamp-to-border color.

Issues

    *   Is the arithmetic for FILTER4 filters correct?  Is this the right
	thing to do?
