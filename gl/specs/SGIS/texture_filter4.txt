Overview

    This extension allows 1D and 2D textures to be filtered using an
    application-defined, four sample per dimension filter.  (In addition to
    the NEAREST and LINEAR filters defined in the original GL Specification.)
    Such filtering results in higher image quality.  It is defined only
    for non-mipmapped filters.  The filter that is specified must be
    symmetric and separable (in the 2D case).

Issues

    *	What should the default filter function be?
        -   Implementation dependent.

    *	Should this extension define 2-wide texture borders?  Do we really
	want to aggrandize this border stuff :-(
        -   No.

    *	Should this extension define 2D filtering only (and not 1D)?
        -   No.

    *	A GLU function that accepts Mitchell parameters and a texture
	target should be defined.

    *	This specification retains a separate filter function description
	with every texture.  In conjunction with EXT_texture_object, this
	may result in a lot of filter functions.  Implementations should
	optimize for the default filter function to save storage cost.

Reasoning

    *	The name is changed from "cubic" to "filter4" because the table
	allows the specification of filters that are not at all cubic in
	nature.  A true cubic filter extension would define the filter
	function as a cubic polynomial.
