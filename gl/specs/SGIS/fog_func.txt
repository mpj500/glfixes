Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required. Written against the OpenGL 1.2 Specification.

Overview

    This extension allows to define application-specific fog blend-factor
    function.  Function is defined by the set of the "control" points and
    should be monotonic. Each control point represented as a pair of the
    eye-space distance value and corresponding value of the fog blending 
    factor. The minimum number of control points is one. The maximum 
    number is implementation dependent.
    

New Procedures and Functions

    void FogFuncSGIS(sizei n, const float* points);

    void GetFogFuncSGIS(float *points);

Issues

   - The Bali team introduced 2 new features in this spec. 1) the
   GetFogFuncSGIS procedure that allows to querry automatically
   the current number of contol points. It is much nicer than
   the previous spec that was using gets. 2) If the user give
   fog blending factor ouside the [0.0, 1.0] range it should not
   generate an error but the valuse should be calmed instead.

   However, this extension has already been shipped and it is a
   problem. We would like to see this extension to be an EXT to
   be able to do the right thing.

   - If the above changes are not acceptable, the sentence "All the points
   of the current fog factor function are queried by calling 
   GetFogFuncSGIS." in section "Additions to Chapter 6 of the 1.2 
   Specification (State and State Requests)" should be replaced by:
   "All the points of the current fog factor function are queried by 
   calling GetFloatv or GetDoublev with <pname> set to FOG_FUNC_SGIS."
   Also, the sentence "INVALID_OPERATION is generated if GetFogFuncSGIS
   is executed between execution of Begin and the corresponding
   execution to End. " in the "Errors" section should be ignored.

   The sentences "The first value of each value pair in <points>
   specifies a value of eye-space distance (should be not negative),
   and the second value of each value pair specifies the corresponding
   value of the fog blend factor. The fog blend factor values are
   clamped to [0.0, 1.0]." should be replced by "The first 
   value of each value pair in <points> specifies a value of eye-space 
   distance (should be not negative), and the second value of each value pair 
   specifies the corresponding value of the fog blend factor (should be in 
   [0.0, 1.0] range)." Also "INVALID_VALUE is generated if fog factor
   value out of [0.0, 1.0] range." should be added to the error section.
