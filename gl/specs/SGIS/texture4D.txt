Overview

    This extension defines 4-dimensional texture mapping.  If EXT_subtexture
    is supported, this extension also defines a mechanism to redefine a
    portion of an existing 4-dimensional texture image.  Because
    EXT_texture3D is required, this extension utilizes the 3-dimensional
    image support defined in by EXT_texture3D as a base for 4-dimensional
    image manipulation.
    
    The 4th dimension has an abstract, rather than physical, reference
    and will be called "extent", since the definition of extent is "that which
    specifies the range or magnitude of an area or volume."

    Four-dimensional texture mapping is more constrained than its one, two,
    and three-dimensional counterparts.  Mipmapping is not supported, so
    only the level-zero 4-dimensional texture image can be defined.  Cubic
    filtering is not supported, so the border width must be either zero or
    one.

    Four-dimensional textures are used primarily as color lookup tables for
    color conversion.
