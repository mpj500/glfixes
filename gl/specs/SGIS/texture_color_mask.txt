Dependencies

    ARB_texture_compression affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension implements the same functionality for texture
    updates that glColorMask implements for color buffer updates.
    Masks for updating textures with indexed internal formats
    (the analog for glIndexMask) should be supported by a separate extension.

    The extension allows an application to update a subset of
    components in an existing texture.	The masks are applied after
    all pixel transfer operations have been performed, immediately
    prior to writing the texel value into texture memory.  They
    apply to all texture updates.

IP Status

    No issues.

Issues

    * The functionality provided by this extension can already be
      performed by using the color mask when rendering to the frame
      buffer and then using CopyTexture to load the texture.

    * This functionality may be hard to achieve with compressed textures.
      It will require a read->decompress->modify->compress->write
      operation.  This may be slower than the DrawPixels/CopyTexture
      approach.
