Overview

    This extension introduces texture magnification filters that blend
    between the level 0 image and a separately defined "detail" image.
    The detail image represents the characteristics of the high frequency
    subband image above the band-limited level 0 image.  The detail image is
    typically a rectangular portion of the subband image which is modified
    so that it can be repeated without discontinuities along its edges.
    Detail blending can be enabled for all color channels, for the alpha
    channel only, or for the red, green, and blue channels only.  It is
    available only for 2D textures.

    WARNING - Silicon Graphics has filed for patent protection for some
	      of the techniques described in this extension document.

Issues

    *	Should detail textures be supported in 1D?  3D?  (Currently
	written to support 2D only)

    *	Is there any need to support detail textures with NEAREST
	or FILTER4 filtering?  (No)

    *	How does detail texture interact with a texture whose
	minimum LOD image is not layer zero?  (Handle this in the LOD
	extension.)

    *	Should six detail filters be defined, so that the MODE is part
	of the filter name?  (LINEAR_ADD_DETAIL_SGIS,
	LINEAR_ADD_DETAIL_ALPHA_SGIS, ...)  (No)

    *	I have scaled and biased the detail texture value to the range [-1,1]
	in this specification.	I believe that Iris GL scaled and biased to
	[-0.5,0.5].  The [-1,1] range seems clearer to me, if it allows F()
	to be limited to [0,1].  Is this acceptable?

    *	Should detail texture objects and 2D texture objects be separate
	sets, or should it be possible to use the same texture object both
	as a detail texture and as a 2D texture?  (Keep them separate)
