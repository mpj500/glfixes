Status

    Complete. Approved by the ARB on June 11, 2003.
    Updated revision 8 approved by the ARB on June 17, 2004.

Version

    Last Modified Date: April 6, 2004
    Revision: 8

Number

    ARB Extension #33

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.5 Specification

    ARB_shader_objects, ARB_fragment_shader, and ARB_vertex_shader are
    required to utilize the OpenGL Shading Language associated with this
    extension.

Overview

    This extension string indicates that the OpenGL Shading Language is
    supported. The Shading Language is defined by a separate specification
    document which can be downloaded from

        http://www.opengl.org/documentation/oglsl.html

Issues

    1) How do we indicate revisions in the supported version of the Shading
       Language?

        RESOLVED: Add a SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION query. This query was not
        present in the initial version of the extension. Therefore,
        applications should be prepared to detect an INVALID_ENUM error
        being raised by glGetString(GL_SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION). If this
        error is raised, but ARB_shading_language_100 is defined in the
        EXTENSIONS string, the application can assume that the initial
        release of the Shading Language (1.00, which was numbered "1.051"
        corresponding to document revision 51) is supported.

    2) What is the format of the SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION string? How does
       it map onto the release number of the shading language specification?

        RESOLVED: Identical to the VERSION string format:
        "major.minor[.release] [vendor info]". The release number is an
        optional vendor release number, not the shading language
        specification document release number (which is never visible to
        apps).

        The "1.051" release number of the initial Shading Language
        specification document corresponds to a SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION
        string of "1.00", since "51" was the revision number of the
        document, not the minor number.

        Going forward, the specification and query must always use the same
        encoding for major and minor numbers. The second release of the
        specification will be labelled "version 1.10, document revision 55",
        and the corresponding SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION string will be "1.10"
        (we chose to bump the minor version directly to 10 to avoid problems
        with leading 0s, and confusion with the old "1.051" document release
        number).

        Document release and vendor release numbers need not have any
        relation to each other, since they represent changes other than
        functionality, such as bug fixes and optimizations (for the
        implementation), and typos and errata for the specification).

        Functional changes to the shading language must always be indicated
        by an increase in the specification minor version number. Such
        changes may or may not correspond to changes to the core OpenGL
        version number as well, depending on whether or not they are visible
        in the OpenGL API.

    3) Should SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION be added to the state tables?

        RESOLVED: Yes. The other GetString queries (VERSION, EXTENSIONS,
        RENDERER, and VENDOR), which have been omitted in the past, should
        also be added, along with a new type code for string state values.

    4) What should the exact wording of the "IP Status" language be?

        Microsoft has made claims towards the low-level vertex shader and
        towards the generic programming framework proposed but not accepted
        into OpenGL 1.4, although that framework did not specify an actual
        shading language. Additional verbal statements made by Dave Aronson
        suggest that Microsoft may feel its claims extend to all
        programmable shading implementations. In fairness to implementers,
        we need to note the possibility of such a claim while also noting
        our lack of any specific information about what IP is being claimed.
