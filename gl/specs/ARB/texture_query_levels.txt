    ARB Extension #140

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.0 is required.

    OpenGL Shading Language 1.30 is required

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.2 specification and 
    version 4.20 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification.

Overview

    This extension provides a new set of texture functions
    (textureQueryLevels) in the OpenGL Shading Language that exposes the
    number of accessible mipmap levels in the texture associated with a GLSL
    sampler variable.  The set of accessible levels includes all the levels of
    the texture defined either through TexImage*, TexStorage*, or TextureView*
    (ARB_texture_view) APIs that are not below the TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL or above
    the TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL parameters.  For textures defined with TexImage*,
    the set of resident levels is somewhat implementation-dependent.  For
    fully defined results, applications should use TexStorage*/TextureView
    unless the texture has a full mipmap chain and is used with a mipmapped
    minification filter.

    These functions means that shaders are not required to manually recompute,
    approximate, or maintain a uniform holding a pre-computed level count,
    since the true level count is already available to the
    implementation. This value can be used to avoid black or leaking pixel
    artifacts for rendering methods which are using texture images as memory
    pages (eg: virtual textures); methods that can't only rely on the fixed
    pipeline texture functions which take advantage of TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL for
    their sampling.
