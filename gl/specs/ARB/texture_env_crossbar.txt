    ARB Extension #18

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification.
    OpenGL 1.1, ARB_multitexture and ARB_texture_env_combine are required 
    by this extension.

Overview

    This extension adds the capability to use the texture color from
    other texture units as sources to the COMBINE_ARB enviornment
    function. The ARB_texture_env_combine extension defined texture 
    enviornment functions which could use the color from the 
    current texture unit as a source. This extension adds
    the ability to use the color from any texture unit as a source.

Issues

 1. Should only "upstream" textures be allowed as inputs to a
    given texture unit? (Texture inputs to unit <m> are restricted to
    the range TEXTURE0_ARB to TEXTURE<m>_ARB).

    - RESOLVED: No. Most vendors support this functionality.


 2. Do we still need TEXTURE as a source if we allow TEXTURE<n>_ARB?

    - RESOLVED: Yes, since this allows backwards compatibility.

 3. What should be the behavior when the texture environment 
    references a texture unit that is not enabled or does not have a
    valid texture object bound to it?

    - RESOLVED: Texture blending should be disabled on the texture 
      unit that is referencing the invalid or disabled texture. This 
      seems to be a reasonable compromise between disabling all 
      texturing and generating "default" texel values. Also, this 
      behavior is more easily forward compatible to an extension 
      which separates the texture lookup and texture blend units.
