Number

    ARB Extension #156

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.1 is required.

    This extension is written against Version 4.3 of the Core Profile OpenGL
    Specification, dated February 14, 2013 and Version 4.30 of the OpenGL
    Shading Language Specification, dated February 7, 2013.

    The presence of the GL_ARB_multi_draw_indirect extension affects the
    definition of this extension.

    The GL_ARB_indirect_parameters extension affects the definition of this
    extension.

Overview

        In unextended GL, vertex shaders have inputs named gl_VertexID and
    gl_InstanceID, which contain, respectively the index of the vertex and
    instance. The value of gl_VertexID is the implicitly passed index of the
    vertex being processed, which includes the value of baseVertex, for those
    commands that accept it. Meanwhile, gl_InstanceID is the integer index
    of the current instance being processed, but, even for commands that
    accept a baseInstance parameter, it does not include the value of this
    argument. Furthermore, the equivalents to these variables in other
    graphics APIs do not necessarily follow these conventions. The reason for
    this inconsistency is that there are legitimate use cases for both
    inclusion and exclusion of the baseVertex or baseInstance parameters
    in gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID, respectively.

        Rather than change the semantics of either built-in variable, this
    extension adds two new built-in variables to the GL shading language,
    gl_BaseVertexARB and gl_BaseInstanceARB, which contain the values passed
    in the baseVertex and baseInstance parameters, respectively. Shaders
    provided by the application may use these variables to offset gl_VertexID
    or gl_InstanceID if desired, or use them for any other purpose.

        Additionally, this extension adds a further built-in variable, gl_DrawID
    to the shading language. This variable contains the index of the draw
    currently being processed by a Multi* variant of a drawing command (such
    as MultiDrawElements or MultiDrawArraysIndirect).
