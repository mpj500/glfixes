Number

    ARB Extension #109

Dependencies

    OpenGL 4.0 or the ARB_transform_feedback2 extension is required.

    OpenGL 3.1 or the ARB_draw_instanced extension is required.

    This extension interacts with the ARB_transform_feedback3 extension.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.1 (Core Profile) specification.

Overview

    Multiple instances of geometry may be specified to the GL by calling
    functions such as DrawArraysInstanced and DrawElementsInstanced. Further,
    the results of a transform feedback operation may be returned to the GL
    by calling DrawTransformFeedback, or DrawTransformFeedbackStream. However,
    it is not presently possible to draw multiple instances of data
    transform feedback without using a query and the resulting round trip from
    server to client.

    This extension adds functionality to draw multiple instances of the result
    of a transform feedback operation.

New Procedures and Functions

    void DrawTransformFeedbackInstanced(enum mode, uint id, sizei primcount);
    void DrawTransformFeedbackStreamInstanced(enum mode, uint id, uint stream, sizei primcount);
