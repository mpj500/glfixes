Overview

    New texture environment function ADD is supported with the following
    equation:
                        Cv = min(1, Cf + Ct)

    New function may be specified by calling TexEnv with ADD token.

    One possible application is to add a specular highlight texture to
    a Gouraud-shaded primitive to emulate Phong shading, in a single
    pass.
