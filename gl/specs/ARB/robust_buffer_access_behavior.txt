Number

    ARB Extension #135

Dependencies

    The ARB_robustness extension is required.
    
    This extension is written against The OpenGL 4.2 (Compatibility Profile)
    specification.

Overview

    This extension specifies the behavior of out-of-bounds buffer and array
    accesses. This is an improvement over the existing ARB_robustness
    extension which stated that the application should not crash, but
    the behavior is otherwise undefined. This extension specifies the access
    protection provided by the GL to ensure that out-of-bounds accesses
    cannot read from or write to data not owned by the application. All
    accesses are contained within the buffer object and program area they
    reference. These additional robustness guarantees apply to contexts
    created with the CONTEXT_FLAG_ROBUST_ACCESS_BIT_ARB feature enabled.
