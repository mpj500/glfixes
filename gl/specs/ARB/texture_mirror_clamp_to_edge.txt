Overview

    ARB_texture_mirror_clamp_to_edge extends the set of texture wrap modes to
    include an additional mode (GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE) that effectively uses
    a texture map twice as large as the original image in which the additional
    half of the new image is a mirror image of the original image.

    This new mode relaxes the need to generate images whose opposite edges
    match by using the original image to generate a matching "mirror image".
    This mode allows the texture to be mirrored only once in the negative
    s, t, and r directions.
