Version

    Last Modified Date: May 2, 2013
    Revision: 4

Number

    ARB Extension #151

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.0 is required.

    This extension depends on ARB_vertex_attrib_binding.

    This extension requires ARB_vertex_type_2_10_10_10_rev.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 (Core Profile)
    Specification (October 18, 2012).

Overview

    This extension adds the following data format:

    A new vertex attribute data format: a packed 11.11.10 unsigned
    float vertex data format.  This vertex data format can be used
    to describe a compressed 3 component stream of values that can
    be represented by 10- or 11-bit unsigned floating point values.

    The UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV vertex attribute type is
    equivalent to the R11F_G11F_B10F texture internal format.
