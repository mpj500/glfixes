Number

    ARB Extension #150

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 specification
    (Compatibility Profile).

Overview

    This extension accepts STENCIL_INDEX8 as a texture internal format, and
    adds STENCIL_INDEX8 to the required internal format list. This removes the
    need to use renderbuffers if a stencil-only format is desired.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
