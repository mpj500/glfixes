Number

    ARB Extension #83

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.2 specification, 
    compatibility profile, but it can apply against previous versions
    of OpenGL.

    Requires OpenGL 3.0 or EXT_texture_integer.

Overview

    This extension adds support for the following data format:

    A new texturing format for unsigned 10.10.10.2 integer textures. 

    OpenGL has supported RGB10 and RGB10_A2 formats for a very long time.  
    This extension provides a variant of RGB10_A2 which supports unsigned 
    integer data (in contrast to the above "unsigned normalized integer" 
    formats).
