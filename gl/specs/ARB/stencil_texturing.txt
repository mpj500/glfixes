Number

    ARB Extension #138

Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1, ARB_depth_texture and EXT_packed_depth_stencil are required.

    This extension is written against The OpenGL 4.2 (Compatibility Profile)
    specification.

Overview

    This extension allows texturing of the stencil component of a packed depth
    stencil texture. Stencil values are returned as unsigned integers. It is
    not possible to sample both depth and stencil values from the same
    texture, and this extension allows the app to select which is sampled for
    the bound texture.
