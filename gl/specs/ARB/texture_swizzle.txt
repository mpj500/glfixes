Number

    ARB Extension #84

Dependencies

     Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 2.1 specification.

Overview

    Classic OpenGL texture formats conflate texture storage and
    interpretation, and assume that textures represent color. In 
    modern applications, a significant quantity of textures don't
    represent color, but rather data like shadow maps, normal maps,
    page tables, occlusion data, etc.. For the latter class of data,
    calling the data "RGBA" is just a convenient mapping of what the
    data is onto the current model, but isn't an accurate reflection
    of the reality of the data.

    The existing texture formats provide an almost orthogonal set of
    data types, sizes, and number of components, but the mappings of 
    this storage into what the shader or fixed-function pipeline 
    fetches is very much non-orthogonal. Previous extensions have
    added some of the most demanded missing formats, but the problem
    has not been solved once and for all.

    This extension provides a mechanism to swizzle the components 
    of a texture before they are applied according to the texture
    environment in fixed-function or as they are returned to the 
    shader.
