    ARB Extension #113

Dependencies

    OpenGL 2.1 is required.
    
    If ARB_map_buffer_range is NOT supported, ignore references to
    MapBufferRange.
    
    This extension is written against The OpenGL 4.1 (Compatibility Profile)
    specification.

Overview

    This extension adds a requirement to the pointer returned by MapBuffer
    and MapBufferRange that they provide a minimum of 64 byte alignment to
    support processing of the data directly with special CPU instructions
    like SSE and AVX.

New Procedures and Functions

    None
