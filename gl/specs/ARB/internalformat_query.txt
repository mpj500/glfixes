Version

    Last Modified Date: June 13, 2011
    Revision: 7 

Number

    ARB Extension #112

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.0 or ARB_framebuffer_object is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.1 (Core Profile)
    Specification (July 25, 2010).

    ARB_texture_multisample affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    OpenGL 4.1 has a number of queries to indicate the maximum number of
    samples available for different formats. These give a coarse-grained
    query mechanism e.g. an implementation can expose different sample
    counts for integer and floating-point formats, but not for different
    floating-point formats. There is also no convenient way for the user
    to determine the granularity of sample counts available, only the
    maximum.

    This extension adds a query mechanism that allows the user to
    determine which sample counts are available for a specific internal
    format.
