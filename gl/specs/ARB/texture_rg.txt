    ARB Extension #53

Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.1 Specification.

    EXT_texture_integer affects the definition of this extension.

    ARB_texture_float affects the definition of this extension.

    EXT_packed_depth_stencil affects the definition of this extension.

    This extension interacts with ARB_framebuffer_object and
    EXT_framebuffer_object.

    This extension is subsumed by OpenGL 3.0.

Overview

    Historically one- and two- component textures have been specified in OpenGL
    using the intensity, luminance or luminance-alpha (I/L/LA) formats.
    With the advent of programmable shaders and render-to-texture capabilites
    these legacy formats carry some historical artifacts which are no longer
    useful.

    For example, when sampling from such textures, the luminance values
    are replicated across the color components, and the intensity values are
    replicated across both the color and alpha components. This is no
    longer necessary with programmable shaders.

    It is also desirable to be able to render to one- and two-
    component format textures using capabilities such as framebuffer
    objects (FBO), but rendering to I/L/LA formats is under-specified
    (specifically how to map R/G/B/A values to I/L/A texture channels).

    This extension adds new base internal formats for the one-component RED
    and two-component RG (red green) texture formats as well as sized
    internal formats for fixed-point, floating-point and pure integer texture
    formats. The new texure formats can be used for texturing as well
    as for rendering into with framebuffer objects.
