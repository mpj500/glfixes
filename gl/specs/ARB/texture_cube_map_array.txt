    ARB Extension #71

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.0 specification and
    version 1.30.08 of the OpenGL Shading Language specification.

Overview

    The GL_EXT_texture_array extension, and subsequently OpenGL 3.0 have
    introduced the concept of one- and two-dimensional array textures.
    An array texture is an ordered set of images with the same size and
    format. Each image in an array texture has a unique level. This
    extension expands texture array support to include cube map
    textures.

    A cube map array texture is a 2-dimensional array texture that may
    contain many cube map layers. Each cube map layer is a unique cube
    map image set. Images in a cube map array have the same size and
    format limitations as one- and two-dimensional array textures. A
    cube map array texture is specified using TexImage3D in a similar
    manner to two-dimensional arrays. Cube map array textures can be
    bound to a render targets of a frame buffer object as
    two-dimensional arrays are using FramebufferTextureLayer.

    When accessed by a programmable shader, a cube map array texture
    acts as a single unit. The "s", "t", "r" texture coordinates are
    treated as a regular cube map texture fetch. The "q" texture is
    treated as an unnormalized floating-point value identifying the
    layer of the cube map array texture. Cube map array texture lookups
    do not filter between layers.

    This extension does not provide for the use of cube map array
    textures with fixed-function fragment processing.
