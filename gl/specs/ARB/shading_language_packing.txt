Number

    ARB Extension #116

Dependencies

    This extension is written against version 4.1 (revision 09) of the OpenGL
    Shading Language Specification.

Overview

    This extension provides the GLSL built-in functions to convert a 32-bit
    unsigned integer holding a pair of 16-bit floating-point values to or from
    a two-component floating-point vector (vec2).  

    This mechanism allows GLSL shaders to read and write 16-bit floating-point
    encodings (via 32-bit unsigned integers) without introducing a full set of
    16-bit floating-point data types.

    This extension also adds the GLSL built-in packing functions included in
    GLSL version 4.00 and the ARB_gpu_shader5 extension which pack and unpack
    vectors of small fixed-point data types into a larger scalar. By putting
    these packing functions in this separate extension it allows
    implementations to provide these functions in hardware that supports them
    independent of the other ARB_gpu_shader5 features.
    
    In addition to the packing functions from ARB_gpu_shader5 this extension
    also adds the missing [un]packSnorm2x16 for completeness.
