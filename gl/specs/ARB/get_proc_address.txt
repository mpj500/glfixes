Status

    Complete. Approved by ARB on 12/8/1999

Version

    Last Modified Date: January 3, 2000

Number

    ARB Extension #2

Dependencies

    The extension is written against the GLX 1.3 Specification.
    May be implemented in any version of GLX and OpenGL.

Overview

    This extension adds a function to return the address of GLX
    and GL extension functions, given the function name. This is
    necessary with (for example) heterogenous implementations where
    hardware drivers may implement extension functions not known to the
    link library; a similar situation on Windows implementations
    resulted in the wglGetProcAddress function.

IP Status

    No IP is believed to be involved (dynamic querying of library entry
    points is supported in all modern operating systems).

Issues

    * Is this extension properly named?

        Yes. If it does not achieve ARB approval, it will be implemented
        as an EXT.

    * Should a typedef be used for the return type?

        typedef void (*GLfunction)();
        extern GLfunction glXGetProcAddressARB(const GLubyte *procName);

        Not needed - see the function declaration

        void (*glXGetProcAddressARB(const GLubyte *procName))();

    * Should GetProcAddressARB allow querying of itself?

        Yes, for sake of completeness.

    * There's a recursion problem with this feature. The purpose of
      GetProcAddressARB is to return pointers to extension functions and
      GetProcAddressARB is itself such a function! This presents a
      puzzle to the application developer.

        Implementations must export the glXGetProcAddressARB entry point
        statically.

    * Should extension functions in GLU and GLX be queryable through
      this extension?

        GLX: Yes. GLU: No. Because the pointers returned are
        context-independent, the query was lifted from GL (in which all
        behavior is necessarily context-dependent) into GLX, where
        context management occurs. Since GLU is an client library using
        GL, GLU extensions are unlikely to need to be dynamically
        queryable. This capability could be added in a future extension.

    * GLU library may not be loaded at runtime, making GLU queries fail

        No longer relevant, since GLU functions cannot be queries now.
        The previous resolution was:

        True. However, the GL/GLX/GLU specifications say nothing about
        "libraries" and link/runtime issues in any event, and the same
        criticism might be applied to GL or GLX queries depending on how
        the development and runtime tools on a particular platform
        operate. Requiring a link against a "GLU library" in this case
        should be in the release notes for a platform.

    * Should corresponding functions exist in the window-system specific
      layer on non-GLX implementations?

        Yes. wglGetProcAddress already exists for Microsoft Windows, and
        Apple has stated they will support aglGetProcAddress.
        Unfortunately, there is an unavoidable inconsistency with
        wglGetProcAddress, which returns context-dependent pointers.
        This should be made abundantly clear in the documentation, so
        that portable applications assume context-dependent behavior.

    * Should the core functions added to GL and GLX since their 1.0
      versions be queryable?

        Yes. This will allow maximum portability of applications across
        OpenGL 1.1 and 1.2 library implementations.

    * Should the core functions in GL 1.0 and GLX 1.0 be queryable?

        Yes. Adds consistency at the cost of a much larger lookup
        mechanism.

    * Are function pointers context-independent?

        Yes. The pointer to an extension function can be used with any
        context which supports the extension. Concern was expressed that
        function dispatch for context-independent pointers would incur
        overheads compared to context-dependent pointers.

        The working group has proposed several implementation strategies
        which would make this overhead negligible to nonexistent, and
        the benefits of lifting the context/pointer management burden
        from applications were considerable. The implementation
        strategies are moderately complex and reach down all the way to
        the toplevel dispatch mechanism used by drivers.

    * Should the pointers returned be required to be equal to the
      addresses of the corresponding static functions (if they exist?)

        No. This may make implementation more difficult and is of little
        apparent value to applications.

    * Should the query return NULL for entry points not supported
      by the implementation, or a pointer to a function which
      generates an error?

        NULL. There is no consistent way to generate errors
        when either GL or GLX functions may be queried.
