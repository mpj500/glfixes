Number

    ARB Extension #65

Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.

    ARB_texture_cube_map is required.

    EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic affects the definition of this extension.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.1 Specification.

Overview

    When sampling from cube map textures, a three-dimensional texture
    coordinate is used to select one of the cube map faces and generate
    a two dimensional texture coordinate ( s t ), at which a texel is
    sampled from the determined face of the cube map texture. Each face
    of the texture is treated as an independent two-dimensional texture,
    and the generated ( s t ) coordinate is subjected to the same
    clamping and wrapping rules as for any other two dimensional texture
    fetch.

    Although it is unlikely that the generated ( s t ) coordinate lies
    significantly outside the determined cube map face, it is often the
    case that the locations of the individual elements required during a
    linear sampling do not lie within the determined face, and their
    coordinates will therefore be modified by the selected clamping and
    wrapping rules. This often has the effect of producing seams or
    other discontinuities in the sampled texture.

    This extension allows implementations to take samples from adjacent
    cube map faces, providing the ability to create seamless cube maps.
