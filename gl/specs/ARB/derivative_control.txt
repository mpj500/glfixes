    ARB Extension #163

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the GLSL 4.40 Specification.

    OpenGL 4.0 and GLSL 4.00 or later are required.

Overview

    This extension provides control over the spacial granularity at which the
    underlying implementation computes derivatives.  

    For example, for the coarse-granularity derivative, a single x derivative
    could be computed for each 2x2 group of pixels, using that same derivative
    value for all 4 pixels.  For the fine-granularity derivative, two
    derivatives could be computed for each 2x2 group of pixels; one for the top
    row and one for the bottom row.  Implementations vary somewhat on how this
    is done.

    To select the coarse derivative, use:

        dFdxCoarse(p)
        dFdyCoarse(p)
        fwidthCoarse(p)

    To select the fine derivative, use:

        dFdxFine(p)
        dFdyFine(p)
        fwidthFine(p)

    To select which ever is "better" (based on performance, API hints, or other
    factors), use:

        dFdx(p)
        dFdy(p)
        fwidth(p)

    This last set is the set of previously existing built-ins for derivatives,
    and continues to work in a backward compatible way.
