Version
    
    Last Modified Date: October 8, 2013
    Revision: #8

Number

    ARB Extension #96

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.0 is required.

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 3.2 compatibility specification.

Overview

    This extension introduces new commands to retrieve and set the binary
    representation of a program object.  GetProgramBinary allows an
    application to cache compiled and linked programs to avoid compiling and
    linking when used again. This may even allow the GL itself to act as an
    offline compiler.  The resulting program binary can be reloaded into the
    GL via ProgramBinary.  This is a very useful path for applications that
    wish to remain portable by shipping pure GLSL source shaders, yet would
    like to avoid the cost of compiling their shaders at runtime.  Instead an
    application can supply its GLSL source shaders during first application run,
    or even during installation.  The application then compiles and links its
    shaders and reads back the program binaries.  On subsequent runs, only the
    program binaries need be supplied.

    ProgramBinary may also accept binaries in vendor-specific formats
    produced by specialized offline compilation tools. This extension does not 
    add any such formats, but allows for them in further extensions. Though the
    level of optimization may not be identical -- the offline shader compiler
    may have the luxury of more aggressive optimization at its disposal --
    program binaries generated online by the GL are interchangeable with those
    generated offline by an SDK tool.
