Status

    Complete. Approved by the ARB on June 9, 2010.
    Approved by the Khronos Board of Promoters on July 23, 2010.

Version

    Version 5, May 7, 2013

Number

    ARB Extension #103

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.2, or an earlier OpenGL version supporting the GL_ARB_sync
    extension, is required.

    An OpenCL implementation supporting sharing event objects
    with OpenGL is required.

Overview

    This extension allows creating OpenGL sync objects linked to OpenCL
    event objects, potentially improving efficiency of sharing images
    and buffers between the two APIs. The companion cl_khr_gl_event
    OpenCL extension provides the complementary functionality of
    creating an OpenCL event object from an OpenGL fence sync object.
    That extension is located in the OpenCL API Registry.
