Number

    ARB Extension #87

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.1 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.2 specification with 
    the Compatibility Profile.

    This extension interacts with NV_vertex_buffer_unified_memory.

    This extension interacts with ARB_instanced_arrays.

    This extension interacts with ARB_compatibility.

Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism for supplying the arguments to a 
    DrawArraysInstanced or DrawElementsInstancedBaseVertex from buffer object
    memory. This is not particularly useful for applications where the CPU 
    knows the values of the arguments beforehand, but is helpful when the 
    values will be generated on the GPU through any mechanism that can write
    to a buffer object including image stores, atomic counters, or compute
    interop. This allows the GPU to consume these arguments without a round-
    trip to the CPU or the expensive synchronization that would involve. This
    is similar to the DrawTransformFeedbackEXT command from 
    EXT_transform_feedback2, but offers much more flexibility in both 
    generating the arguments and in the type of Draws that can be accomplished.
