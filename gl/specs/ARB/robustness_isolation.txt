Number

    ARB Extension #126

Dependencies

    GL_ARB_robustness is required.

Overview

    GL_ARB_robustness and supporting window system extensions allow
    creating an OpenGL context supporting graphics reset notification
    behavior.  GL_ARB_robustness_isolation provides stronger
    guarantees about the possible side-effects of a graphics reset.

    It is expected that there may be a performance cost associated
    with isolating an application or share group from other contexts
    on the GPU. For this reason, GL_ARB_robustness_isolation is
    phrased as an opt-in mechanism, with a new context creation bit
    defined in the window system bindings. It is expected that
    implementations might only advertise the strings in this extension
    if both the implementation supports the desired isolation
    properties, and the context was created with the appropriate reset
    isolation bit.
