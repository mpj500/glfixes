Number

    ARB Extension #59

Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 3.0 (August 11, 2008 draft)
    specification.

Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism to do an accelerated copy from one
    buffer object to another. This may be useful to load buffer objects
    in a "loading thread" while minimizing cost and synchronization effort
    in the "rendering thread."
