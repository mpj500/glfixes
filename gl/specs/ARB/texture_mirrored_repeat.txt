Number

    ARB Extension #21

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.
    However, this extension does not require OpenGL 1.3.

Overview

    ARB_texture_mirrored_repeat extends the set of texture wrap modes to
    include a mode (GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT_ARB) that effectively uses a texture
    map twice as large at the original image in which the additional half,
    for each coordinate, of the new image is a mirror image of the original
    image.

    This new mode relaxes the need to generate images whose opposite edges
    match by using the original image to generate a matching "mirror image".

Issues

 1. The spec clamps the final (u,v) coordinates to the range [0.5, 2^n-0.5].
    This will produce the same effect as trapping a sample of the border texel
    and using the corresponding edge texel.  The choice of technique is purely
    an implementation detail.


 2. The IBM_texture_mirrored_repeat extension inadvertantly used an HP
    enumerant value (0x8370) allocated by HP as an interleaved array format.
    Should the enumerant value be changed if this becomes an ARB extension?

    No, it is not worth the confusion created by having two different
    enumerant value for the same token.

 3. Should additional mirroring functions be added to this extension and
    perhaps rename it to ARB_texture_mirror. For example, include the two
    mirror modes (MIRROR_CLAMP_ATI and MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE_ATI) provided
    for in the GL_ATI_texture_mirror_once extension.

    No, these extensions are not interdependent and inclusion of the
    mirror once will likely hinder the adoption of this extension.
