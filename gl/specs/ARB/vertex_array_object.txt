    ARB Extension #54

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.1 specification (December
    1st, 2006).

    APPLE_vertex_array_object affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension introduces named vertex array objects which encapsulate
    vertex array state on the client side.  These objects allow applications
    to rapidly switch between large sets of array state.  In addition, layered
    libraries can return to the default array state by simply creating and
    binding a new vertex array object.

    This extension differs from GL_APPLE_vertex_array_object in that client
    memory cannot be accessed through a non-zero vertex array object.  It also
    differs in that vertex array objects are explicitly not sharable between
    contexts.

New Procedures and Functions

    void BindVertexArray(uint array);

    void DeleteVertexArrays(sizei n, const uint *arrays);

    void GenVertexArrays(sizei n, uint *arrays);

    boolean IsVertexArray(uint array);
