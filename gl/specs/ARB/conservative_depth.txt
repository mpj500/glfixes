Number

    ARB Extension #111

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.0 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language Version 4.00.

Overview

    There is a common optimization for hardware accelerated implementation of
    OpenGL which relies on an early depth test to be run before the fragment
    shader so that the shader evaluation can be skipped if the fragment ends
    up being discarded because it is occluded.

    This optimization does not affect the final rendering, and is typically
    possible when the fragment does not change the depth programmatically.
    (i.e.: it does not write to the built-in gl_FragDepth output). There are,
    however a class of operations on the depth in the shader which could
    still be performed while allowing the early depth test to operate.

    This extension allows the application to pass enough information to the
    GL implementation to activate such optimizations safely.

New Procedures and Functions
