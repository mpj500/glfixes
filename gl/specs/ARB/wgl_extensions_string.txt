Overview

    This extension provides a way for applications to determine which
    WGL extensions are supported by a device. This is the foundation
    upon which other WGL extensions are built.

IP Status

    No issues.

Issues

  1. Note that extensions that were previously advertised via
     glGetString (e.g., the swap interval extension) should continue to
     be advertised there so existing applications don't break. They
     should also be advertised via wglGetExtensionsStringARB so new
     applications can make one call to find out which WGL extensions are
     supported.

  2. Should this function take an hdc? It seems like a good idea. At
     some point MS may want to incorporate this into OpenGL32. If they
     do this and and they want to support more than one ICD, then an HDC
     would be needed.

New Procedures and Functions

    const char *wglGetExtensionsStringARB(HDC hdc);
