Number

    ARB Extension #129

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.0 and ARB_geometry_shader4, or OpenGL 3.2 is required.

    ARB_viewport_array is required.
    
    This extension is written against The OpenGL Shading Language 4.20.11
    Specification.

    This extension interacts with NV_gpu_program4.

Overview

    The geometry shader has the special built-in variables gl_Layer and
    gl_ViewportIndex that specify which layer and viewport primitives
    are rendered to. Currently the fragment shader does not know which
    layer or viewport the fragments are being written to without the
    application implementing their own interface variables between
    the geometry and fragment shaders.
    
    This extension specifies that the gl_Layer and gl_ViewportIndex
    built-in variables are also available to the fragment shader so the
    application doesn't need to implement these manually.
