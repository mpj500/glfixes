Number

    ARB Extension #64

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.1 Specification but
    can apply to any prior specification.

    ARB_geometry_shader4, EXT_geometry_shader4, NV_geometry_shader4,
    and NV_gpu_program4 interact with this extension

    EXT_transform_feedback, NV_transform_feedback, and the transform
    feedback functionality made core by OpenGL 3.0 are clarified by
    this extension.

Overview

    This extension provides an alternative provoking vertex convention
    for rendering lines, triangles, and (optionally depending on the
    implementation) quads.

    The provoking vertex of a primitive is the vertex that determines the
    constant primary and secondary colors when flat shading is enabled.

    In OpenGL, the provoking vertex for triangle, quad, line, and
    (trivially) point primitives is the last vertex used to assemble
    the primitive.  The polygon primitive is an exception in OpenGL where
    the first vertex of a polygon primitive determines the color of the
    polygon, even if actually broken into triangles and/or quads.

    See section 2.14.7 (Flatshading) of the OpenGL 2.1 specification,
    particularly Table 2.12 for more details.

    Alternatively the provoking vertex could be the first vertex of
    the primitive.  Other APIs with flat-shading functionality such
    as Reality Lab and Direct3D have adopted the "first vertex of the
    primitive" convention to determine the provoking vertex.  However,
    these APIs lack quads so do not have a defined provoking vertex
    convention for quads.

    The motivation for this extension is to allow applications developed
    for APIs with a "first vertex of the primitive" provoking vertex to
    be easily converted to OpenGL.
