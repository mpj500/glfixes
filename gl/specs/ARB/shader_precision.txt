Number

    ARB Extension #98

Dependencies

    This extension is written against OpenGL 4.0.

    OpenGL 4.0 is required.

Overview

    This extension more clearly restricts the precision requirements of 
    implementations of the GLSL specification.  These include precision of 
    arithmetic operations (operators '+', '/', ...), transcendentals (log, exp, 
    pow, reciprocal sqrt, ...), when NaNs (not a number) and INFs (infinities) will
    be supported and generated, and denorm flushing behavior.  Trigonometric 
    built-ins and some other categories of built-ins are not addressed.
