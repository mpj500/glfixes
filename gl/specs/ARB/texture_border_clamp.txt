Status

    Complete.  Approved by the ARB, 20 June 2000

Version

    1.0, 22 June 2000

Number

    ARB Extension #13

Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.0 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification.

    This extension is based on and intended to replace
    GL_SGIS_texture_border_clamp.

Overview

    The base OpenGL provides clamping such that the texture coordinates are
    limited to exactly the range [0,1].  When a texture coordinate is clamped
    using this algorithm, the texture sampling filter straddles the edge of
    the texture image, taking 1/2 its sample values from within the texture
    image, and the other 1/2 from the texture border.  It is sometimes
    desirable for a texture to be clamped to the border color, rather than to
    an average of the border and edge colors.

    This extension defines an additional texture clamping algorithm.
    CLAMP_TO_BORDER_ARB clamps texture coordinates at all mipmap levels such
    that NEAREST and LINEAR filters return only the color of the border
    texels.

IP Status

    No known IP issues.

Issues

    (1) Is this formulation correct for higher-order texture filters 
        (e.g., cubic or anisotropic filters)?
        
       RESOLVED:  No.  A more appropriate formulation would clamp the texture
       coordinates in texel space. 

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
