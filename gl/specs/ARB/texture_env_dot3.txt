Number

    ARB Extension #19

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification.
    OpenGL 1.1, ARB_multitexture and ARB_texture_env_combine are required 
    for this extension.

Overview

    Adds new operation to the texture combiner operations.

        DOT3_RGB_ARB                    Arg0 <dotprod> Arg1
        DOT3_RGBA_ARB                   Arg0 <dotprod> Arg1

    where Arg0, Arg1 are specified by <params> parameter of 
    TexEnvf, TexEnvi, TexEnvfv, and TexEnviv when the <pname>
    parameter value is SOURCE0_RGB_ARB and SOURCE1_RGB_ARB.
    
Issues

 1. This extension is an ARB version of EXT_texture_env_dot3 which bears
    a copyright by ATI Technologies. Is ATI willing to have the ARB
    go ahead and modify their original spec and use it for the 
    ARB extension.

    - RESOLVED: ATI does not have a problem with the copyright issue.

 2. The EXT version of the spec does not multiply the output by 
    RGB_SCALE_ARB and ALPHA_SCALE_ARB. There is no reason to impose this
    restriction since it makes the scale operations non-orthogonal. 
    Should the enum values for the new tokens in this extension should
    be the same as the original EXT version?

    - RESOLVED: No.
