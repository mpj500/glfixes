    Revision: 4

Number

    ARB Extension #108

Dependencies

    GLSL 1.3 is required for all features.  GLSL 1.4 is required 
    declaring a binding for a uniform block, as uniform blocks were not 
    present until version 1.4.

    This extension interacts with the ARB_shader_image_load_store 
    extension, for assigning locations to image variables.

    References to *patch* are not valid unless tessellation stages are
    present and enabled.

    While this document is self-contained, clarifying context for how to 
    add the following changes can be seen by looking at version 4.20 of 
    the GLSL specification.
