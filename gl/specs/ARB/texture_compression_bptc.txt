    NVIDIA Revision:            7

Number

    ARB Extension #77

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.1 is required.

    GL_ARB_texture_compression is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.2 Specification 
    (Compatibility Profile).

Overview

    This extension provides additional texture compression functionality
    specific to the BPTC and BPTC_FLOAT compressed texture formats (called BC7
    and BC6H respectively in Microsoft's DirectX API), subject to all the
    requirements and limitations described by the extension
    GL_ARB_texture_compression.

    Traditional block compression methods as typified by s3tc and latc
    compress a block of pixels into indicies along a gradient. This works well
    for smooth images, but can have quality issues along sharp edges and
    strong chrominance transitions. To improve quality in these problematic
    cases, the BPTC formats can divide each block into multiple partitions,
    each of which are compressed using an independent gradient.

    In addition, it is desirable to directly support high dynamic range
    imagery in compressed formats, which is accomplished by the BPTC_FLOAT
    formats.
