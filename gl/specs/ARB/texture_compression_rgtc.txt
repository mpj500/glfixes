Number

    ARB Extension #52

Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.3 or ARB_texture_compression required

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 (September 7,
    2004) specification.

    This extension interacts with OpenGL 2.0 and ARB_texture_non_power_of_two.

Overview

    This extension introduces four new block-based texture compression
    formats suited for unsigned and signed red and red-green textures
    (hence the name "rgtc" for Red-Green Texture Compression).

    These formats are designed to reduce the storage requirements
    and memory bandwidth required for red and red-green textures by
    a factor of 2-to-1 over conventional uncompressed luminance and
    luminance-alpha textures with 8-bit components (GL_LUMINANCE8 and
    GL_LUMINANCE8_ALPHA8).

    The compressed signed red-green format is reasonably suited for
    storing compressed normal maps.

    This extension uses the same compression format as the
    EXT_texture_compression_latc extension except the color data is stored
    in the red and green components rather than luminance and alpha.
    Representing compressed red and green components is consistent with
    the BC4 and BC5 compressed formats supported by DirectX 10.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
