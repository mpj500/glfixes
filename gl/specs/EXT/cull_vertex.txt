Overview

    This extension introduces a method for culling vertexes in object
    space based on the value of the dot product between the normal at
    the vertex and a culling eye direction.

    Culling a polygon by examining its vertexes in object space can be
    more efficient than screen space polygon culling since the transformation
    to screen space (which may include a division by w) can be avoided for
    culled vertexes.  Also, vertex culling can be computed before vertexes
    are assembled into primitives.  This is a useful property when drawing
    meshes with shared vertexes, since a vertex can be culled once, and the
    resulting state can be used for all primitives which share the vertex.

Issues

    * Should FrontFace affect the comparison of the dot product?
      It may be useful.  For non-local eye positions it is easy for
      the application to flip the eye direction in order to cull
      either front or back faces.  This doesn't work as well for
      local eye positions.  We'll defer this for now; it is easy
      to add as an extension later.

    * Could determine the eye position/direction in object space
      by transforming the vector (0, 0, 1, 0) by the inverse of
      the composite of the modelview and projection transformations.
      Seems better to have the application provide the eye position/direction
      than to have OpenGL pick one arbitrarily.
