Dependencies

    EXT_paletted_texture is required

Overview

    This extends the definition of texturing so that it is supported
    in color index mode.  This extension builds on the notion of
    texture images which have color index internal formats which was
    introduced in EXT_paletted_texture.

    This extension also introduces a new texture environment function
    ADD which is useful for combining lighting and texturing in
    color index mode.

Issues

    * EXT_paletted_texture should probably have defined
        TEXTURE_BORDER_INDEX
        TEXTURE_INDEX_SIZE
      Should we go ahead and introduce them in this extension?

    * ADD is defined differently for RGBA mode in SGIX_texture_add_env
      Should we add TEXTURE_ENV_SHIFT and TEXTURE_ENV_OFFSET parameters
      so that the environment functions works similarly?  Probably not.
