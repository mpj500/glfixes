Overview

    When normal rescaling is enabled a new operation is added to the
    transformation of the normal vector into eye coordinates.  The normal vector 
    is rescaled after it is multiplied by the inverse modelview matrix and 
    before it is normalized.  

    The rescale factor is chosen so that in many cases normal vectors with unit
    length in object coordinates will not need to be normalized as they
    are transformed into eye coordinates.
