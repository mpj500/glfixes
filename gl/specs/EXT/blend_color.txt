Overview

    Blending capability is extended by defining a constant color that can
    be included in blending equations.  A typical usage is blending two
    RGB images.  Without the constant blend factor, one image must have
    an alpha channel with each pixel set to the desired blend factor.

New Procedures and Functions

    void BlendColorEXT(clampf red,
                       clampf green,
                       clampf blue,
                       clampf alpha);
