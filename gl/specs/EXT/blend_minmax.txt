Number

    OpenGL Extension #37
    OpenGL ES Extension #65

Dependencies

    There is an interaction with OpenGL ES.

Overview

    Blending capability is extended by respecifying the entire blend
    equation.  While this document defines only two new equations, the
    BlendEquationEXT procedure that it defines will be used by subsequent
    extensions to define additional blending equations.

    The two new equations defined by this extension produce the minimum
    (or maximum) color components of the source and destination colors.
    Taking the maximum is useful for applications such as maximum projection
    in medical imaging.

Issues

    *   I've prefixed the ADD token with FUNC, to indicate that the blend
        equation includes the parameters specified by BlendFunc.  (The min
        and max equations don't.)  Is this necessary?  Is it too ugly?
        Is there a better way to accomplish the same thing?
