Status

    Complete.

Version

    Version 1 (November 4, 2011)

Number

    414

Dependencies

    This specification is written against the GLX 1.4 specification, but
    only GLX 1.1 or greater with the ARB_get_proc_address extension is
    required, for glXQueryExtensionString and glXGetProcAddressARB
    respectively.

    GLX_EXT_swap_control is required.

    Based on WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear version 1.

    This extension affects GLX_NV_swap_group.

Overview

    This extension extends the existing GLX_EXT_swap_control extension by
    allowing a negative <interval> parameter to glXSwapIntervalEXT. The
    negative <interval> allows late swaps to occur without synchronization
    to the video frame. This reduces the visual stutter on late frames and
    reduces the stall on subsequent frames.

IP Status

    There are no known IP issues.

Issues

    This extension is incompatible with GLX_NV_swap_group. If a drawable is
    currently part of a swap group, late unsynchronized swaps will implicitly be
    disabled for that drawable.

New Procedures and Functions
