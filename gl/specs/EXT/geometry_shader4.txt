Overview

    EXT_geometry_shader4 defines a new shader type available to be run on the
    GPU, called a geometry shader. Geometry shaders are run after vertices are
    transformed, but prior to color clamping, flat shading and clipping.

    A geometry shader begins with a single primitive (point, line,
    triangle). It can read the attributes of any of the vertices in the
    primitive and use them to generate new primitives. A geometry shader has a
    fixed output primitive type (point, line strip, or triangle strip) and
    emits vertices to define a new primitive. A geometry shader can emit
    multiple disconnected primitives. The primitives emitted by the geometry
    shader are clipped and then processed like an equivalent OpenGL primitive
    specified by the application.

    Furthermore, EXT_geometry_shader4 provides four additional primitive
    types: lines with adjacency, line strips with adjacency, separate
    triangles with adjacency, and triangle strips with adjacency.  Some of the
    vertices specified in these new primitive types are not part of the
    ordinary primitives, instead they represent neighboring vertices that are
    adjacent to the two line segment end points (lines/strips) or the three
    triangle edges (triangles/tstrips). These vertices can be accessed by
    geometry shaders and used to match up the vertices emitted by the geometry
    shader with those of neighboring primitives.

    Since geometry shaders expect a specific input primitive type, an error
    will occur if the application presents primitives of a different type.
    For example, if a geometry shader expects points, an error will occur at
    Begin() time, if a primitive mode of TRIANGLES is specified.
