Number

    OpenGL Extension #462
    OpenGL ES Extension #226

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 (Compatibility Profile)
    specification.

    This extension requires OpenGL ES 3.0.3 (December 18, 2013) in an
    OpenGL ES implementation.

    This extension interacts with NV_fragment_coverage_to_color.

    This extension interacts with EXT_depth_bounds_test.

    This extension interacts with OES_sample_shading.

    This extension interacts with OES_sample_variables.

Overview

    This extension allows rendering to a non-multisample color buffer while
    rasterizing with more than one sample. The result of rasterization
    (coverage) is available in the gl_SampleMaskIn[] fragment shader input,
    multisample rasterization is enabled for all primitives, and several per-
    fragment operations operate at the raster sample rate.

    When using the functionality provided by this extension, depth, stencil,
    and depth bounds tests must be disabled, and a multisample draw
    framebuffer must not be used.

    A fragment's "coverage", or "effective raster samples" is considered to
    have "N bits" (as opposed to "one bit" corresponding to the single color
    sample) through the fragment shader, in the sample mask output, through
    the multisample fragment operations and occlusion query, until the coverage
    is finally "reduced" to a single bit in a new "Coverage Reduction" stage
    that occurs before blending.

New Procedures and Functions

    void RasterSamplesEXT(uint samples, boolean fixedsamplelocations);
