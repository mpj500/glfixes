Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.2, or an earlier OpenGL version supporting the ARB_sync
    extension, is required.

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 3.2 specification.

    ARB_cl_event trivially affects the definition of this extension.

    This extension is only supported with contexts created on an X11
    display that supports the X Synchronization Extension version 3.1 or
    later.

Overview

    Synchronization objects added the ability to better coordinate
    operations between multiple GL command streams.  However, it is
    desirable to have the same level of coordination between GL
    command streams and external rendering APIs.  This extension
    introduces two new concepts to build upon the synchronization
    infrastructure provided by ARB_sync:

      1) A means to import an X Synchronization Fence object into the
         GL and use it as a sync object.

      2) The concept of a reusable sync object.

    The latter is necessary because the import operation is expensive
    and performing it every time a synchronization point was reached
    would make the synchronization prohibitively slow.

    This extension stops short of allowing the GL to change the state
    of imported/reusable sync objects, but does not add any language
    that would prohibit such functionality from being added in a
    subsequent extension.
