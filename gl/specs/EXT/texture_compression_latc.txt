Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.3 or ARB_texture_compression required

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 (September 7,
    2004) specification.

    This extension interacts with OpenGL 2.0 and ARB_texture_non_power_of_two.

Overview

    This extension introduces four new block-based texture compression
    formats suited for unsigned and signed luminance and luminance-alpha
    textures (hence the name "latc" for Luminance-Alpha Texture
    Compression).

    These formats are designed to reduce the storage requirements and
    memory bandwidth required for luminance and luminance-alpha textures
    by a factor of 2-to-1 over conventional uncompressed luminance and
    luminance-alpha textures with 8-bit components (GL_LUMINANCE8 and
    GL_LUMINANCE8_ALPHA8).

    The compressed signed luminance-alpha format is reasonably suited
    for storing compressed normal maps.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
