Overview
 
    The EXT_texture_sRGB extension (promoted to core in OpenGL 2.1)
    provides a texture format stored in the sRGB color space. Sampling one
    of these textures will always return the color value decoded into a
    linear color space. However, an application may wish to sample and
    retrieve the undecoded sRGB data from the texture and manipulate
    that directly.
 
    This extension adds a Texture Parameter and Sampler Object parameter to
    allow sRGB textures to be read directly, without decoding.
    
    The new parameter, TEXTURE_SRGB_DECODE_EXT controls whether the 
    decoding happens at sample time. It only applies to textures with an 
    internal format that is sRGB and is ignored for all other textures. 
    This value defaults to DECODE_EXT, which indicates the texture 
    should be decoded to linear color space.
