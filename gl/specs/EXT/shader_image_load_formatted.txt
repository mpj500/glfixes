    OpenGL Extension #449

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 specification
    (Compatibility Profile).

    This extension is written against version 4.30 of the OpenGL
    Shading Language Specification.

    This extension interacts with GL_NV_bindless_texture.

    This extension interacts with GL_EXT_shader_image_load_store and
    NV_gpu_program5.

Overview

    ARB_shader_image_load_store (and OpenGL 4.2) added support for
    random access load and store from/to texture images, but due to 
    hardware limitations, loads were required to declare the image
    format in the shader source. This extension relaxes that 
    requirement, and the return values from imageLoad can be format-
    converted based on the format of the image binding.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
