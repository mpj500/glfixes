Overview

    This extension provides support for packed pixels in host memory.  A
    packed pixel is represented entirely by one unsigned byte, one
    unsigned short, or one unsigned integer.  The fields with the packed
    pixel are not proper machine types, but the pixel as a whole is.  Thus
    the pixel storage modes, including PACK_SKIP_PIXELS, PACK_ROW_LENGTH,
    PACK_SKIP_ROWS, PACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT_EXT, PACK_SKIP_IMAGES_EXT,
    PACK_SWAP_BYTES, PACK_ALIGNMENT, and their unpacking counterparts all
    work correctly with packed pixels.
