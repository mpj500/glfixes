Number

    OpenGL Extension #439
    OpenGL ES Extension #98

Dependencies
    
    Requires OpenGL ES 1.1.
    
    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL ES 2.0.25 Full Specification
    (November 2, 2010).

    OpenGL ES 1.1 affects the definition of this extension.

    OES_framebuffer_object affects the definition of this extension.
    
    OES_vertex_array_object affects the definition of this extension.

    EXT_occlusion_query_boolean affects the definition of this extension.

    EXT_separate_shader_objects affects the definition of this extension.
    
    OpenGL ES 3.0 affects the definition of this extension.
    
    OpenGL 3.3+ and 4.0+ affect the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension defines a mechanism for OpenGL and OpenGL ES applications to 
    label their objects (textures, buffers, shaders, etc.) with a descriptive 
    string. 
    
    When profiling or debugging such an application within a debugger or 
    profiler it is difficult to identify resources from their object names. 
    Even when the resource itself is viewed it can be problematic to 
    differentiate between similar resources. Attaching a label to an object         
    helps obviate this difficulty.
    
    The intended purpose of this is purely to improve the user experience 
    within OpenGL and OpenGL ES development tools.

New Procedures and Functions

    void LabelObjectEXT(enum type, uint object, sizei length, 
        const char *label);
    void GetObjectLabelEXT(enum type, uint object, sizei bufSize, 
        sizei *length, char *label);
