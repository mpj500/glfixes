Overview

    Blending capability is extended by defining a function that allows
    independent setting of the RGB and alpha blend factors for blend
    operations that require source and destination blend factors.  It
    is not always desired that the blending used for RGB is also applied
    to alpha.

New Procedures and Functions

    void BlendFuncSeparateEXT(enum sfactorRGB,
                              enum dfactorRGB,
                              enum sfactorAlpha,
                              enum dfactorAlpha);
