    How does EXT_texture_mirror_clamp extend ATI_texture_mirror_once?

        This EXT extension provides the two wrap modes that
        ATI_texture_mirror_once adds but also adds a third new wrap mode
        (GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_EXT).  This extension uses the same
        enumerant values for the ATI_texture_mirror_once modes.

    Why is the GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_EXT mode more interesting than
    the two other modes?

        Rather than clamp to 100% of the edge of the texture
        (GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE_EXT) or to 50% of the edge and border
        color (GL_MIRROR_CLAMP), it is preferable to clamp to 100%
        of the border color (GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_EXT).  This
        avoids "bleeding" at smaller mipmap levels.

        Consider a texture that encodes a circular fall-off pattern such
        as for a projected spotlight.  A circular pattern is bi-symmetric
        so a "mirror clamp" wrap modes can reduce the memory footprint
        of the texture by a fourth.  Far outside the spotlight pattern,
        you'd like to sample 100% of the border color (typically black
        for a spotlight texture).  The way to achieve this without any
        bleeding of edge texels is with GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_EXT.

    Does this extension complete the orthogonality of the current five
    OpenGL 1.5 wrap modes?

         Yes.  There are two ways for repetition to operate (repeated
         & mirrored) and four ways for texture coordinate clamping to
         operate (unclamped, clamp, clamp to edge, & clamp to border).
         The complete table of all 8 modes looks like this:

                          Repeat            Mirror
                         +----------------  ----------------------
         Unclamped       | REPEAT           MIRRORED_REPEAT
         Clamp           | CLAMP            MIRROR_CLAMP
         Clamp to edge   | CLAMP_TO_EDGE    MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE
         Clamp to border | CLAMP_TO_BORDER  MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER

         OpenGL 1.0 introduced REPEAT & CLAMP.
         OpenGL 1.2 introduced CLAMP_TO_EDGE
         OpenGL 1.3 introduced CLAMP_TO_BORDER
         OpenGL 1.4 introduced MIRRORED_REPEAT
         ATI_texture_mirror_once introduced MIRROR_CLAMP & MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE
         EXT_texture_mirror_clamp introduces MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER

    Do these three new wrap modes work with 1D, 2D, 3D, and cube map
    texture targets?

         RESOLUTION: Yes.

    Do these three new wrap modes work with ARB_texture_non_power_of_two
    functionality?
    
         RESOLUTION: Yes.

    Do these three new wrap modes interact with NV_texture_rectangle?

         RESOLUTION:  Mirroring wrap modes are not supported by
         GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_NV textures.  Conventional mirroring is
         already not supported for texture rectangles so supporting
         clamped mirroring modes should not be supported either.

    Does the specification of MIRROR_CLAMP_EXT & MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE_EXT
    match the ATI_texture_mirror_once specification?

         I believe yes.  The ATI_texture_mirror_once specification is
         somewhat vague what happens to texture coordinates at or very
         near (within half a texel of) zero.  The presumption is that a
         CLAMP_TO_EDGE behavior is used.  This specification is quite
         explicit that values near zero are clamped to plus or minus
         1/(2*N) respectively so that the CLAMP_TO_EDGE behavior is
         explicit.

    What should this extension be called?

         Calling the extension EXT_texture_mirror_once might cause
         confusion since this extension has additional functionality.
         Also, "once" never appears in the specification.
         EXT_texture_mirror_clamp is a good name because it implies
         support for all the clamped versions of mirroring.

    There is GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT and then GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_EXT,
    GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE_EXT, and GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_EXT.
    Why does the first enumerant name say "MIRRORED" while the other
    three say "MIRROR"?

         This extension follows the naming precedent set by the
         ATI_texture_mirror_once specification.

         Moreover, MIRRORED_REPEAT uses "mirrored" to help that the
         mirroring repeats infinitely.  For the other three modes,
         there is just one mirror that occurs and then a clamp.

Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 1.4.

    Extends ATI_texture_mirror_once by adding
    GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_EXT.

    NV_texture_rectangle trivially affects the definition of this
    extension.

Overview

    EXT_texture_mirror_clamp extends the set of texture wrap modes to
    include three modes (GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_EXT, GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE_EXT,
    GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_BORDER_EXT) that effectively use a texture map
    twice as large as the original image in which the additional half
    of the new image is a mirror image of the original image.

    This new mode relaxes the need to generate images whose opposite
    edges match by using the original image to generate a matching
    "mirror image".  This mode allows the texture to be mirrored only
    once in the negative s, t, and r directions.
