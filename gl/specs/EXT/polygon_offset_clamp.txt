Number

    OpenGL Extension #460

Dependencies

    OpenGL 3.3 (either core or compatibility profiles) is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile)
    Specification (March 11, 2010).

Overview

    This extension adds a new parameter to the polygon offset function
    that clamps the calculated offset to a minimum or maximum value.
    The clamping functionality is useful when polygons are nearly
    parallel to the view direction because their high slopes can result
    in arbitrarily large polygon offsets. In the particular case of
    shadow mapping, the lack of clamping can produce the appearance of
    unwanted holes when the shadow casting polygons are offset beyond
    the shadow receiving polygons, and this problem can be alleviated by
    enforcing a maximum offset value.
