Overview

    This extension provides a way for applications to determine which
    WGL extensions are supported by a device.  This is the foundation
    upon which other WGL extensions are built.

Issues

    Note that extensions that were previously advertised via glGetString
    (e.g., the swap interval extension) should continue to be advertised
    there so existing applications don't break.  They should also be
    advertised via wglGetExtensionsStringEXT so new applications can make
    one call to find out which WGL extensions are supported.

New Procedures and Functions

    const char *wglGetExtensionsStringEXT(void);
