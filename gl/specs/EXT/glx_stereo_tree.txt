    OpenGL Extension #452

Dependencies

    This specification is written against the wording of the GLX 1.4
    Specification.

    A minimum of GLX 1.3, or GLX 1.2 with the GLX_SGIX_pbuffer
    extension is required.

    GLX_SGIX_pbuffer affects the definition of this extension.

    The X Generic Event extension affects the definition of this
    extension.

Overview

    When using stereoscopic rendering with the X composite extension,
    a stereo-aware GLX composite manager can be used to composite both
    the left and right buffers of a window's backing pixmap to
    the left and right buffers of the root or composite overlay window
    to preserve the stereo effect of a redirected window or any of its
    child windows.  However, to do this, the composite manager needs a
    method to determine which windows have both left and right buffers
    available without needing to walk entire window trees or be aware
    of other clients' GLX drawables.

    This extension provides a new drawable tree query, which can be
    used by the composite manager when it begins tracking a window,
    and an event, which can be used to listen for updates to a tracked
    window.  This query and event provide the composite manager with a
    boolean value representing the stereo status of an entire
    redirected window tree.  With this information, the composite
    manager is able to properly choose between a stereoscopic or
    monoscopic format when creating a GLXPixmap for a given window
    tree's backing pixmap.
