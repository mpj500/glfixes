Overview

    EXT_clip_volume_hint provides a mechanism for applications to
    indicate that they do not require clip volume clipping for
    primitives. It allows applications to maximize performance in
    situations where they know that clipping is unnecessary.
    EXT_clip_volume_hint is only an indication, though, and
    implementations are free to ignore it.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens
