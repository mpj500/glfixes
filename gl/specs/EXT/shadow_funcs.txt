Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.
    ARB_depth_texture is required.
    ARB_shadow is required.
    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification. 

Overview

    This extension generalizes the GL_ARB_shadow extension to support all
    eight binary texture comparison functions rather than just GL_LEQUAL
    and GL_GEQUAL.

IP Status

    None.

Issues

    (1) What should this extension be called?

      RESOLUTION: EXT_shadow_funcs.  The extension adds new texture
      compare (shadow) comparison functions to ARB_shadow.

    (2) Are there issues with GL_EQUAL and GL_NOTEQUAL?

      The GL_EQUAL mode (and GL_NOTEQUAL) may be difficult to obtain
      well-defined behavior from. This is because there is no guarantee
      that the divide done by the shadow mapping r/q division is going
      to exactly match the z/w perspective divide and depth range scale
      & bias used to generate depth values.  Perhaps it can work in a
      well-defined manner in orthographic views or if you can guarantee
      that the texture hardware's r/q is computed with the same hardware
      used to compute z/w (NVIDIA's NV_texture_shader extension can
      provide such a guarantee).

      Similiarly, GL_LESS and GL_GREATER or only different from GL_LEQUAL
      and GL_GEQUAL respectively by a single unit of depth precision
      which may make the difference between these modes very subtle.
