Dependencies

    EXT_blend_minmax affects the definition of this extension

Overview

    Two additional blending equations are specified using the interface
    defined by EXT_blend_minmax.  These equations are similar to the
    default blending equation, but produce the difference of its left
    and right hand sides, rather than the sum.  Image differences are
    useful in many image processing applications.
