Number

    OpenGL Extension #464
    OpenGL ES Extension #227

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 Specification
    (Compatibility Profile), dated February 14, 2013.

    OpenGL 1.0 is required.

    This extension interacts with EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic.

    This extension interacts with EXT_direct_state_access.

    This extension interacts with OpenGL ES 3.1 (June 4, 2014).

    When implemented for OpenGL ES 3.1, this extension interacts with
    EXT_texture_border_clamp.

    When implemented for OpenGL ES 3.1, this extension interacts with
    OES_texture_stencil8.

Overview

    In unextended OpenGL 4.3, minification and magnification filters such as
    LINEAR allow texture lookups to returned a filtered texel value produced
    by computing an weighted average of a collection of texels in the
    neighborhood of the texture coordinate provided.

    This extension provides a new texture and sampler parameter
    (TEXTURE_REDUCTION_MODE_EXT) which allows applications to produce a
    filtered texel value by computing a component-wise minimum (MIN) or
    maximum (MAX) of the texels that would normally be averaged.  The
    reduction mode is orthogonal to the minification and magnification filter
    parameters.  The filter parameters are used to identify the set of texels
    used to produce a final filtered value; the reduction mode identifies how
    these texels are combined.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
