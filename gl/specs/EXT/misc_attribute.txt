Overview

    EXT_misc_attribute extends the list of attribute groups. It provides
    a miscellaneous group, controlled by the MISC_BIT_EXT bit, that contains
    the attribute state of extensions that don't logically fit in any other
    group. 

Reasoning

    In general, an extension's attributes are assigned to a similar
    attribute group. If an extension is developed that doesn't fit in
    any of the GL's existing attribute groups, the extension's attributes
    should be added to the miscellaneous group.
        
    The GL sample implementation incorrectly checks the bits in
    the <mask> argument to PushAttrib and glXCopyContext,
    generating an error if any unused bits are set. This
    behavior causes interoperability problems between GLs with
    different sets of attribute groups. This error checking
    should be removed from all implementations. The reference
    to this error checking should also be removed from the GLX
    specification.

    Because of the bit checking described above, ALL_ATTRIB_BITS
    can't include MISC_BIT_EXT without risking GL interoperability
    problems. Not including MISC_BIT_EXT changes the semantics of
    ALL_ATTRIB_BITS, but is considered the lesser of two evils.
    These problems should be fixed in the next GL version.
