Overview

    The original intention of this extension was simply to support various
    numeric resolutions of color components in texture images.  While it
    accomplishes this, it also accomplishes a larger task, that of
    formalizing the notion of an internal format for images, corresponding
    to the external format that already existed for image data in host
    memory.  This notion of an internal image format will be used
    extensively in later extensions, especially those concerned with pixel
    manipulation.

    The idea of an internal format is simple: rather than treating a
    retained image as having 1, 2, 3, or 4 components, treat it as though
    it has a specific format, such as LUMINANCE_ALPHA, or just ALPHA.  Then
    define the semantics of the use of internal images with these formats in
    a consistent way.  Because texture mapping is already defined in GL, the
    semantics for internal-format images were chosen to match those of the 1,
    2, 3, and 4 component internal images that already existed.  The new
    semantics are a superset of the old ones, however, so this extension
    adds capabilities to GL, as well as allowing internal resolutions to be
    specified.

    This extension also defines a robust method for applications to
    determine what combinations of texture dimensions and resolutions are
    supported by an implementation.  It also introduces a new texture
    environment: REPLACE_EXT.
