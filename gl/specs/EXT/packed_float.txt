Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 required

    ARB_color_buffer_float affects this extension.

    EXT_texture_shared_exponent trivially affects this extension.

    EXT_framebuffer_object affects this extension.

    WGL_ARB_pixel_format is required for use with WGL.

    WGL_ARB_pbuffer affects WGL pbuffer support for this extension.

    GLX 1.3 is required for use with GLX.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 (September 7,
    2004) specification.

Overview

    This extension adds a new 3-component floating-point texture format
    that fits within a single 32-bit word.  This format stores 5 bits
    of biased exponent per component in the same manner as 16-bit
    floating-point formats, but rather than 10 mantissa bits, the red,
    green, and blue components have 6, 6, and 5 bits respectively.
    Each mantissa is assumed to have an implied leading one except in the
    denorm exponent case.  There is no sign bit so only non-negative
    values can be represented.  Positive infinity, positive denorms,
    and positive NaN values are representable.  The value of the fourth
    component returned by a texture fetch is always 1.0.

    This extension also provides support for rendering into an unsigned
    floating-point rendering format with the assumption that the texture
    format described above could also be advertised as an unsigned
    floating-point format for rendering.

    The extension also provides a pixel external format for specifying
    packed float values directly.
