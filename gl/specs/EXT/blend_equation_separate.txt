Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 1.5 specification.

    OpenGL 1.4 (or ARB_imaging, or EXT_blend_minmax and/or
    EXT_blend_subtract) is required for blend equation support.

    EXT_blend_func_separate is presumed but not required.

    EXT_blend_logic_op interacts with this extension.

Overview

    EXT_blend_func_separate introduced separate RGB and alpha blend
    factors.  EXT_blend_minmax introduced a distinct blend equation for
    combining source and destination blend terms.  (EXT_blend_subtract &
    EXT_blend_logic_op added other blend equation modes.)  OpenGL 1.4
    integrated both functionalities into the core standard.

    While there are separate blend functions for the RGB and alpha blend
    factors, OpenGL 1.4 provides a single blend equation that applies
    to both RGB and alpha portions of blending.

    This extension provides a separate blend equation for RGB and alpha
    to match the generality available for blend factors.

Issues

    Why not use ATI_blend_equation_separate?

        Apple supports this extension in OS X 10.2 but the extension
        lacks a specification and, as explained in subsequent issues,
        the token naming is inconsistent with OpenGL conventions.

    What should the token names be?

        RESOLVED:  Follow the precedent of EXT_blend_equation_separate.
        For example, GL_BLEND_DST becomes GL_BLEND_DST_RGB
        and GL_BLEND_DST_ALPHA.  So GL_BLEND_EQUATION becomes
        GL_BLEND_EQUATION_RGB (same value as GL_BLEND_EQUATION) and
        GL_BLEND_EQUATION_ALPHA.

        This is different from the ATI_blend_equation_separate approach
        which introduces the single name GL_ALPHA_BLEND_EQUATION_ATI
        (no RGB name is introduced).  The existing OpenGL convention
        (example: ARB_texture_env_combine) is to use _RGB and _ALPHA as
        a suffix for enumerants, not a prefix.

    How should get token values be assigned?

        RESOLVED:  GL_BLEND_EQUATION_RGB_EXT has the same value as
        GL_BLEND_EQUATION.  See "Compatibility" section.

        For compatibility with ATI_blend_equation_separate,
        GL_BLEND_EQUATION_ALPHA_EXT shares the same value (0x883D)
        with the ATI_blend_equation_separate's GL_ALPHA_BLEND_EQUATION_ATI
        token.  The GL_BLEND_EQUATION_ALPHA_EXT name uses the suffixing
        convention (rather than prefixing) for adding _ALPHA addition
        as done by ARB_texture_env_combine and EXT_blend_func_separate.

New Procedures and Functions

    void BlendEquationSeparateEXT(enum modeRGB,
                                  enum modeAlpha);

New Tokens


        BLEND_EQUATION_RGB_EXT             0x8009 (same as BLEND_EQUATION)
        BLEND_EQUATION_ALPHA_EXT           0x883D
