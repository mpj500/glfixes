Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 1.5 specification.

    OpenGL 1.4 (or ARB_imaging, or EXT_blend_minmax and/or
    EXT_blend_subtract) is required for blend equation support.

    EXT_blend_func_separate is presumed but not required.

    EXT_blend_logic_op interacts with this extension.

New Procedures and Functions

    void BlendEquationSeparateEXT(enum modeRGB,
                                  enum modeAlpha);

New Tokens


        BLEND_EQUATION_RGB_EXT             0x8009 (same as BLEND_EQUATION)
        BLEND_EQUATION_ALPHA_EXT           0x883D
