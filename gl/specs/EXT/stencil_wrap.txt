Overview

    Various algorithms use the stencil buffer to "count" the number of
    surfaces that a ray passes through.  As the ray passes into an object,
    the stencil buffer is incremented.  As the ray passes out of an object,
    the stencil buffer is decremented.

    GL requires that the stencil increment operation clamps to its maximum
    value.  For algorithms that depend on the difference between the sum
    of the increments and the sum of the decrements, clamping causes an
    erroneous result.

    This extension provides an enable for both maximum and minimum wrapping
    of stencil values.  Instead, the stencil value wraps in both directions.

    Two additional stencil operations are specified.  These new operations
    are similiar to the existing INCR and DECR operations, but they wrap
    their result instead of saturating it.  This functionality matches
    the new stencil operations introduced by DirectX 6.
