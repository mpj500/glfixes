    Revision: 3

Number

    OpenGL Extension #440
    OpenGL ES Extension #99

Dependencies
    
    Requires OpenGL ES 1.1.

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL ES 2.0.25 Full Specification
    (November 2, 2010).

Overview

    This extension defines a mechanism for OpenGL and OpenGL ES applications to
    annotate their command stream with markers for discrete events and groups 
    of commands using descriptive text markers. 
    
    When profiling or debugging such an application within a debugger or 
    profiler it is difficult to relate the commands within the command stream 
    to the elements of the scene or parts of the program code to which they 
    correspond. Markers help obviate this by allowing applications to specify 
    this link.
    
    The intended purpose of this is purely to improve the user experience 
    within OpenGL and OpenGL ES development tools.
