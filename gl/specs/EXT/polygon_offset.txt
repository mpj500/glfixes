Overview

    The depth values of fragments generated by rendering polygons are
    displaced by an amount that is proportional to the maximum absolute
    value of the depth slope of the polygon, measured and applied in window
    coordinates.  This displacement allows lines (or points) and polygons
    in the same plane to be rendered without interaction -- the lines
    rendered either completely in front of or behind the polygons
    (depending on the sign of the offset factor).  It also allows multiple
    coplanar polygons to be rendered without interaction, if different
    offset factors are used for each polygon.  Applications include
    rendering hidden-line images, rendering solids with highlighted edges,
    and applying `decals' to surfaces.
