Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 specification and version
    1.10.59 of the OpenGL Shading Language specification.

    This extension interacts with GL_EXT_geometry_shader4.

Overview

    This extension introduces the concept of bindable uniforms to the OpenGL
    Shading Language.  A uniform variable can be declared bindable, which
    means that the storage for the uniform is not allocated by the
    compiler/linker anymore, but is backed by a buffer object.  This buffer
    object is bound to the bindable uniform through the new command
    UniformBufferEXT().  Binding needs to happen after linking a program
    object.

    Binding different buffer objects to a bindable uniform allows an
    application to easily use different "uniform data sets", without having to
    re-specify the data every time.

    A buffer object can be bound to bindable uniforms in different program
    objects. If those bindable uniforms are all of the same type, accessing a
    bindable uniform in program object A will result in the same data if the
    same access is made in program object B.  This provides a mechanism for
    'environment uniforms', uniform values that can be shared among multiple
    program objects.

New Procedures and Functions

    void UniformBufferEXT(uint program, int location, uint buffer);
    int GetUniformBufferSizeEXT(uint program, int location);
    intptr GetUniformOffsetEXT(uint program, int location);
