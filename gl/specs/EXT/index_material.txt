Overview

    This extends color index lighting to include a way for the current
    index to contribute to the color index produced by lighting.  This
    works much like ColorMaterial does for RGBA lighting by allowing
    one or more color index material properties to be attached to the
    current index.

    The color index lighting formula is also modified so that the lit
    color index may be bitwise shifted in order to allow greater control
    when using lighting and fog together in color index mode.
