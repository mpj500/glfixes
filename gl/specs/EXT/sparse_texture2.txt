    OpenGL Extension #463

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.4 Specification
    (Compatibility Profile), dated July 21, 2013

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language
    Specification, version 4.40, revision 6.

    This extension requires and extends ARB_sparse_texture.

    This extension interacts trivially with EXT_depth_bounds_test.

    This extension interacts with NV_gpu_program4 and NV_gpu_program5.

Overview

    This extension builds on the ARB_sparse_texture extension, providing the
    following new functionality:

      * New built-in GLSL texture lookup and image load functions are provided
        that return information on whether the texels accessed for the texture
        lookup accessed uncommitted texture memory.

      * New built-in GLSL texture lookup functions are provided that specify a
        minimum level of detail to use for lookups where the level of detail
        is computed automatically.  This allows shaders to avoid accessing
        unpopulated portions of high-resolution levels of detail when it knows
        that the memory accessed is unpopulated, either from a priori
        knowledge or from feedback provided by the return value of previously
        executed "sparse" texture lookup functions.

      * Reads of uncommitted texture memory will act as though such memory
        were filled with zeroes; previously, the values returned by reads were
        undefined.

      * Standard implementation-independent virtual page sizes for internal 
        formats required to be supported with sparse textures. These standard
        sizes can be requested by leaving VIRTUAL_PAGE_SIZE_INDEX_ARB at its
        initial value (0).

      * Support for creating sparse multisample and multisample array textures
        is added.  However, the virtual page sizes for such textures remain
        fully implementation-dependent.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
