Status

    Shipping in an NVIDIA OpenGL ES 1.x implementation

Version

    1.0, August 12, 2008

Number

    OpenGL Extension #309
    OpenGL ES Extension #49

Dependencies

    OpenGL-ES 1.0 is required. Since OpenGL-ES 1.0 is specified using
    the OpenGL 1.3 Specification as a base, this extension references
    the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.

Overview

    Support of EXT_texture_compression_s3tc is attractive for OpenGL-ES
    implementations because it provides compressed textures that allow
    for significantly reduced texture storage. Reducing texture storage is 
    advantageous because of the smaller memory capacity of many embedded 
    systems compared to desktop systems. Smaller textures also provide a
    welcome performance advantage since embedded platforms typically provide
    less performance than desktop systems. S3TC compressed textures 
    are widely supported and used by applications. The DXT1 format is 
    used in the vast majority of cases in which S3TC compressed textures 
    are used.
    
    However, EXT_texture_compression_s3tc specifies functionality that is
    burdensome for an OpenGL-ES implementation. In particular it requires
    that the driver provide the capability to compress textures into 
    S3TC texture formats, as an S3TC texture format is accepted as the
    <internalformat> parameter of TexImage2D and CopyTexImage2D. Further,
    EXT_texture_compression_s3tc may require conversion from one S3TC 
    format to another during CompressedTexSubImage2D if the <format> 
    parameter does not match the <internalformat> of the texture image 
    previously created by TexImage2D.

    In an OpenGL-ES implementation it is therefore advantageous to support 
    a limited subset of EXT_texture_compression_s3tc: Restrict supported 
    texture formats to DXT1 and restrict supported operations to those
    that do not require texture compression into an S3TC texture format or
    decompression from an S3TC texture format.
