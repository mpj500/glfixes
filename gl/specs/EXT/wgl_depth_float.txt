Overview

    For perspective scenes, the density of objects (vertices) increases
    as the distance from the eye increases.  For a linear depth buffer,
    this means that objects (vertices) are sparse for a large portion of
    the depth range and are dense for a small portion of the depth buffer.

    This behavior is obvious if you consider standing in a boat looking
    at the shore.  The near objects include only the boat while the far
    objects include the entire shoreline which may include an entire city.

    A non-linear (floating-point) depth buffer helps this problem.  If
    the near clipping plane is set to 1.0, and the far clipping plane is
    set to 0.0, a much greater resolution of objects can occur.
