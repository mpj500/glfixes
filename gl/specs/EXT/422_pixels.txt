Overview

    This extension provides support for converting 422 pixels in host
    memory to 444 pixels as part of the pixel storage operation.

    The pixel unpack storage operation treats a 422 pixel as a 2 element
    format where the first element is C (chrominance) and the second
    element is L (luminance). Luminance is present on all pixels; a full
    chrominance value requires two pixels.

    The pixel pack storage operation converts RGB to a 422 pixel defined as
    a 2 element format where the first element stored is C (chrominance)
    and the second element stored is L (luminance).  Luminance is present
    on all pixels; a full chrominance value requires two pixels.

    Both averaging and non-averaging is supported for green and blue
    assignments for pack and unpack operations.
