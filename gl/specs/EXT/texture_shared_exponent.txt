Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 required

    ARB_color_buffer_float affects this extension.

    EXT_framebuffer_object affects this extension.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 (September 7,
    2004) specification.

Overview

    Existing texture formats provide either fixed-point formats with
    limited range and precision but with compact encodings (allowing 32
    or fewer bits per multi-component texel), or floating-point formats
    with tremendous range and precision but without compact encodings
    (typically 16 or 32 bits per component).

    This extension adds a new packed format and new internal texture
    format for encoding 3-component vectors (typically RGB colors) with
    a single 5-bit exponent (biased up by 15) and three 9-bit mantissas
    for each respective component.  There is no sign bit so all three
    components must be non-negative.  The fractional mantissas are
    stored without an implied 1 to the left of the decimal point.
    Neither infinity nor not-a-number (NaN) are representable in this
    shared exponent format.

    This 32 bits/texel shared exponent format is particularly well-suited
    to high dynamic range (HDR) applications where light intensity is
    typically stored as non-negative red, green, and blue components
    with considerable range.
