Overview

    This extension provides a simple method for OpenGL to read and store
    images whose pixels have CMYK or CMYKA formats.  The algorithms used to
    convert to RGBA from CMYKA and to convert back from RGBA to CMYKA are of
    the "black-box" nature, meaning that the application has little control
    over how the conversion is done.  Also, this black-box mechanism is
    available only for transfers to or from memory, not for internal copies
    of pixel data (such as invoked by CopyPixels, CopyTexImage1D, etc.)
    However, the defined mechanism nicely handles 5-component CMYKA images,
    and it is very easy to use.

    A more configurable and potentially higher quality color conversion can
    be implemented using the color tables, the color matrix, and possibly 3D
    and 4D texture lookup.  Such a color conversion also applies to copied
    pixel data.
