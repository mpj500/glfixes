Overview

    This extension adds two object space tessellation methods for GLU nurbs 
    surfaces. The existing tessellation methods GLU_PATH_LENGTH and 
    GLU_PARAMETRIC_ERROR are view dependent since the error tolerance is 
    measured in the screen space (in pixels), while the corresponding object
    space tessellation methods are view independent in that the error tolerance
    measurement is in the object space.
