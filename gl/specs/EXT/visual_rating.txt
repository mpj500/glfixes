Overview

    This extension allows servers to identify a particular GLX visual as 
    undesirable. A new visual attribute is introduced, providing a way
    for servers to specify caveats (e.g., slow) for a visual. The attribute 
    may be queried using glXGetConfig, and can therefore be used by 
    application-specific visual selection routines. The new attribute is 
    also used by glXChooseVisual to discriminate against visuals with
    caveats.

    This extension allows servers to export visuals with improved features
    or image quality, but lower performance or greater system burden,
    without having to have these visuals selected preferentially.  It is
    intended to insure that most applications get the "right" visual, not
    that all applications do.

Issues

    It is possible for an application to unknowingly select a visual with 
    caveats, if it is unaware of the GLX_VISUAL_CAVEAT_EXT attribute. Also, if 
    the server supports this extension but the client library does not, then 
    glXChooseVisual may select a visual with caveats. The latter problem can be 
    rectified if/when this extension is incorporated into GLX 1.3, since the 
    server knows the clients version and can avoid exporting visuals with 
    caveats to client libraries that don't know how to handle them. (Note that 
    the server does not know which GLX extensions a client supports.)

Reasoning

    This extension is designed to be automatic -- applications don't have
    to use it explicitly. glXChooseVisual always prefers visuals with
    no caveats.

    Because visuals that don't have a GLX_VISUAL_CAVEAT_EXT attribute are 
    treated as good visuals, applications need not concern themselves with 
    whether a server supports EXT_visual_rating or not.  This allows 
    operation to be automatic.

    The new visual attribute is defined as an enumerated type so additional
    caveats, such as GLX_RESOURCE_HOG_EXT, can be introduced in the future.
