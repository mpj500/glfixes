Overview

    Conventionally, OpenGL assumes framebuffer color components are stored
    in a linear color space.  In particular, framebuffer blending is a
    linear operation.

    The sRGB color space is based on typical (non-linear) monitor
    characteristics expected in a dimly lit office.  It has been
    standardized by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
    as IEC 61966-2-1. The sRGB color space roughly corresponds to 2.2
    gamma correction.

    This extension adds a framebuffer capability for sRGB framebuffer
    update and blending.  When blending is disabled but the new sRGB
    updated mode is enabled (assume the framebuffer supports the
    capability), high-precision linear color component values for red,
    green, and blue generated by fragment coloring are encoded for sRGB
    prior to being written into the framebuffer.  When blending is enabled
    along with the new sRGB update mode, red, green, and blue framebuffer
    color components are treated as sRGB values that are converted to
    linear color values, blended with the high-precision color values
    generated by fragment coloring, and then the blend result is encoded
    for sRGB just prior to being written into the framebuffer.

    The primary motivation for this extension is that it allows OpenGL
    applications to render into a framebuffer that is scanned to a monitor
    configured to assume framebuffer color values are sRGB encoded.
    This assumption is roughly true of most PC monitors with default
    gamma correction.  This allows applications to achieve faithful
    color reproduction for OpenGL rendering without adjusting the
    monitor's gamma correction.
