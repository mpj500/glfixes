Overview

    This extension defines an interface which allows vertex array
    data to be cached or pre-compiled for more efficient rendering.  This
    is useful for implementations which can cache the transformed results
    of array data for reuse by several DrawArrays, ArrayElement, or
    DrawElements commands.  It is also useful for implementations which
    can transfer array data to fast memory for more efficient processing.

    For example, rendering an M by N mesh of quadrilaterals can be
    accomplished by setting up vertex arrays containing all of the
    vertexes in the mesh and issuing M DrawElements commands each of
    which operate on 2 * N vertexes.  Each DrawElements command after
    the first will share N vertexes with the preceding DrawElements
    command.  If the vertex array data is locked while the DrawElements
    commands are executed, then OpenGL may be able to transform each
    of these shared vertexes just once.
