Status

    Completed.

Version

    Version 8 (November 8, 2011)

Number

    375

Dependencies

    This specification is written against the GLX 1.3 specification, but
    only GLX 1.1 or greater with the ARB_get_proc_address extension is
    required, for glXQueryExtensionString and glXGetProcAddressARB
    respectively.

    This specification affects the GLX_SGI_swap_control extension.

    Based on GLX_MESA_swap_control version 1.1, GLX_SGI_swap_control
    version 1.9, and WGL_EXT_swap_control version 1.5.

Overview

    This extension allows an application to specify a minimum
    periodicity of color buffer swaps, measured in video frame periods,
    for a particular drawable. It also allows an application to query
    the swap interval and the implementation-dependent maximum swap
    interval of a drawable.

IP Status

    There are no known IP issues.

Issues

    1. Should implementations that export GLX_EXT_swap_control also
    export GL_EXT_swap_control?

    RESOLVED: No. GL_EXT_swap_control is exported by WGL_EXT_swap_control
    because of shortcomings in the WGL extension querying mechanisms. GLX
    has no such shortcomings, so exporting only a GLX extension is
    sufficient.

    2. How should the swap interval interact with non-visible drawables?

    RESOLVED: The definition of the swap interval does not make sense
    when applied to drawables that are not visible on a display device,
    so it makes no sense to modify or query the swap interval of such
    drawables.  BadWindow should be returned if the <drawable> argument
    of glXSwapIntervalEXT is not a window, and the result of querying
    the swap interval of a non-window drawable should be undefined.

    3. How should the implementations maximum swap interval and current
    swap interval be exposed?

    RESOVLED: These are both properties of a GLX drawable, so they are
    exposed through glXQueryDrawable.

New Procedures and Functions

    void glXSwapIntervalEXT(Display *dpy,
                            GLXDrawable drawable,
                            int interval);
