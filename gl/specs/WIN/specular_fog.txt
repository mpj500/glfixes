Overview

    Specularly lit textures enhance the realism of a scene greatly.
    Using the current OpenGL lighting model, one cannot obtain specularly lit 
    textures. This is because in the current OpenGL lighting model lighting
    is done ahead of texturing and texture-functions such as modulate are 
    inadequate for such a simulation. What needs to be addressed is that, 
    somehow an additional interpolant (specular color of that material) needs 
    to be propagated till that stage of the pipeline where texture-mapping is
    performed. This interpolant is then added on to the fragment's color
    resulting from the texturing process before proceeding with the rest of 
    the pipeline.

    This can be addressed very easily in software, but hardware
    is not so malleable. Currently most hardware does not support such a

    lighting model. However, some current hardware does support fogging,
    which takes place in the pipeline after texturing. This hardware 
    assumes that the fog blend factor f is computed per-vertex and
    interpolates the value across the primitive. The WIN_specular_fog
    extension enables the use of such existing fog circuitry to obtain 
    specularly lit textures without much performance degradation. 

    To use it the programmer simply enables the extension with a call to
    Enable with the appropriate enumerant and sets the fog color to the 
    desired specular color.

Issues

    1) This extension works only if: 
                * Lighting is enabled.
                * Texturing is enabled.
                * Texture function is MODULATE.
                * Two sided lighting is disabled.
                * RenderMode is RENDER.

    2) When both fogging and the extension are enabled, the FOG_HINT bit
       is ignored.

    3) One limitation is that the FOG_COLOR is used as the specular-highlight
       color. 

    4) PushAttrib and PopAttrib calls save and restore the extension related
       state when the FOG_BIT is set, along with the rest of the fog related
       state information. 
    
    5) The highlight computed by this extension is linear-interpolation based 
       and therefore appears similar to the highlights available for untextured 
       Gouraud polygons. If Phong shading (ext #113) is enabled this similarity
       will no longer hold as the Phong highlight is computed per-pixel.  This
       can result in the enabling of texture causing the highlight to move and 
       change shape.
