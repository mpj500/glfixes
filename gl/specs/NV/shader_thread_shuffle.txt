    OpenGL Extension #448

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 (Compatibility Profile)
    Specification.

    This extension is written against version 4.30 (revision 07) of the OpenGL 
    Shading Language Specification.

    OpenGL 4.3 and GLSL 4.3 are required.

    This extension interacts with NV_gpu_program5

Overview

    Implementations of the OpenGL Shading Language may, but are not required, 
    to run multiple shader threads for a single stage as a SIMD thread group, 
    where individual execution threads are assigned to thread groups in an 
    undefined, implementation-dependent order.  This extension provides a set 
    of new features to the OpenGL Shading Language to share data between 
    multiple threads within a thread group. 
    
    Shaders using the new functionalities provided by this extension should 
    enable this functionality via the construct
    
        #extension GL_NV_shader_thread_shuffle : require     (or enable)

    This extension also specifies some modifications to the program assembly
    language to support the thread data sharing functionalities.
