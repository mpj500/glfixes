Support

    NVIDIA plans to discontinue this extension for future GPU
    architectures.  Support for NV3x (GeForce FX), NV4x (GeForce 6
    Series), and G7x (GeForce 7x00) architectures will continue.

    As an alternative to the EXT_texture_expand_normal functionality,
    developers can either use the signed fixed-point texture formats
    provided by NV_texture_shader (such as GL_SIGNED_RGBA8_NV) or perform
    the "expand normal" operation with shader instructions (typically
    just a MAD)..

Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
