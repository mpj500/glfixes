Dependencies

    OpenGL 4.0 (Core or Compatibiity Profile) is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.2 Specification
    (Compatibility Profile).

    NV_gpu_program4 and NV_gpu_program5 are required.

    ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object is required.

    This specification interacts with NV_shader_atomic_float.

Overview

    This extension provides assembly language support for shader storage
    buffers (from the ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object extension) for all
    program types supported by NV_gpu_program5, including compute programs
    added by the NV_compute_program5 extension.

    Assembly programs using this extension can read and write to the memory of
    buffer objects bound to the binding points provided by
    ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
