Number

    OpenGL Extension #436

Dependencies

    OpenGL 2.1 is required.

Overview

    For most interactive applications, the standard rendering loop responding
    to input events on a frame granularity is sufficient.  Some more demanding
    applications may want to exchange performance for the ability to sample
    input closer to the final frame swap and adjust rendering accordingly. 
    This extension adds functionality to allow the application to wait until a
    specified time before a swapbuffers command would be able to execute.
