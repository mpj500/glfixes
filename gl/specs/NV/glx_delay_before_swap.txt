Number

    OpenGL Extension #445

Dependencies

    Requires GLX 1.1

    Requires EXT_swap_control

    Interacts with EXT_swap_control_tear

    This specification is written against the wording of the GLX 1.4 and
    is based on the WGL_NV_delay_before_swap specifications

Overview

    For most interactive applications, the standard rendering loop responding
    to input events on a frame granularity is sufficient.  Some more demanding
    applications may want to exchange performance for the ability to sample
    input closer to the final frame swap and adjust rendering accordingly.
    This extension adds functionality to allow the application to wait until a
    specified time before a swapbuffers command would be able to execute.
