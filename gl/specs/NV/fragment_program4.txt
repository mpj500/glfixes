Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.

    NV_gpu_program4 is required.  This extension is supported if
    "GL_NV_gpu_program4" is found in the extension string.

    ATI_draw_buffers and ARB_draw_buffers trivially affects the definition of
    this specification.

    ARB_fragment_program_shadow trivially affects the definition of this
    specification.

    NV_primitive_restart trivially affects the definition of this extension.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 specification.

Overview

    This extension builds on the common assembly instruction set
    infrastructure provided by NV_gpu_program4, adding fragment
    program-specific features.

    This extension provides interpolation modifiers to fragment program
    attributes allowing programs to specify that specified attributes be
    flat-shaded (constant over a primitive), centroid-sampled (multisample
    rendering), or interpolated linearly in screen space.  The set of input
    and output bindings provided includes all bindings supported by
    ARB_fragment_program.  Additional input bindings are provided to determine
    whether fragments were generated by front- or back-facing primitives
    ("fragment.facing"), to identify the individual primitive used to generate
    the fragment ("primitive.id"), and to determine distances to user clip
    planes ("fragment.clip[n]").  Additionally generic input attributes allow
    a fragment program to receive a greater number of attributes from previous
    pipeline stages than possible using only the pre-defined fixed-function
    attributes.

    By and large, programs written to ARB_fragment_program can be ported
    directly by simply changing the program header from "!!ARBfp1.0" to
    "!!NVfp4.0", and then modifying instructions to take advantage of the
    expanded feature set.  There are a small number of areas where this
    extension is not a functional superset of previous fragment program
    extensions, which are documented in the NV_gpu_program4 specification.
