Number

    OpenGL Extension #465
    OpenGL ES Extension #228

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 specification
    (Compatibility Profile) but may be used with the Core profile or
    OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.

    When this extension is used with the Core profile or an OpenGL ES
    context, references to functionality specific to the Compatibility
    Profile can be ignored.
    
Overview

    This extension adds a "conservative" rasterization mode where any pixel
    that is partially covered, even if no sample location is covered, is 
    treated as fully covered and a corresponding fragment will be shaded.

    A new control is also added to modify window coordinate snapping 
    precision.

    These controls can be used to implement "binning" to a low-resolution
    render target, for example to determine which tiles of a sparse texture
    need to be populated. An app can construct a framebuffer where there is
    one pixel per tile in the sparse texture, and adjust the number of
    subpixel bits such that snapping occurs to the same effective grid as when
    rendering to the sparse texture. Then triangles should cover (at least)
    the same pixels in the low-res framebuffer as they do tiles in the sparse
    texture.
