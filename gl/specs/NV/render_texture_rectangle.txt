Dependencies 

    OpenGL 1.1 is required. 

    WGL_ARB_render_texture is required.

    GL_NV_texture_rectangle is required.

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification. 

Overview 

    This extension allows a color buffer with non-power-of-two dimensions to
    be used for both rendering and texturing.  It is built upon the
    ARB_render_texture extension; the only addition in this extension is the
    ability to bind a texture to a texture rectangle target, as provided
    through the NV_texture_rectangle extension.

Issues 

    What is the interaction of this spec and the WGL_MIPMAP_TEXTURE_ARB
    attribute?

      RESOLVED:  NV_texture_rectangle doesn't support mipmaps, so it's kind of
      stupid to allocate them.  Trying will result in an error.

    Should there be separate pixel format attributes for
    BIND_TO_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_RGB and RGBA?  Or is a simple
    BIND_TO_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE attribute sufficient?

      RESOLVED:  Separate capabilities.  There may be pixel formats where
      rendered texture rectangles are supported, but conventional textures are
      not.  If a single BIND_TO_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE attribute were used, there
      would be no cue for RGB/RGBA binding support, and the existing
      attributes would signal the ability to render to conventional textures.

      Alternately, pixel formats could be constrained so that the only
      render-texture capable formats are those that support all allowable
      targets.
