    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 1.2.1 specification.

Overview

    It is useful to be able to multiply a number by itself in the blending
    stages -- for example, in certain types of specular lighting effects
    where a result from a dot product needs to be taken to a high power.

    This extension provides four additional blending factors to permit
    this and other effects: SRC_COLOR and ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR for source
    blending factors, and DST_COLOR and ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR for destination
    blending factors.

    Direct3D provides capability bits for advertising these additional
    blend modes.
