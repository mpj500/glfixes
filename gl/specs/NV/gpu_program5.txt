Dependencies

    OpenGL 2.0 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.0 specification.

    NV_gpu_program4 and NV_gpu_program4_1 are required.

    NV_shader_buffer_load is required.

    NV_shader_buffer_store is required.

    This extension is written against and interacts with the NV_gpu_program4,
    NV_vertex_program4, NV_geometry_program4, and NV_fragment_program4
    specifications.

    This extension interacts with NV_tessellation_program5.

    This extension interacts with ARB_transform_feedback3.

    This extension interacts trivially with NV_shader_buffer_load.

    This extension interacts trivially with NV_shader_buffer_store.

    This extension interacts trivially with NV_parameter_buffer_object2.

    This extension interacts trivially with OpenGL 3.3, ARB_texture_swizzle,
    and EXT_texture_swizzle.

    This extension interacts trivially with ARB_blend_func_extended.

    This extension interacts trivially with EXT_shader_image_load_store.

    This extension interacts trivially with ARB_shader_subroutine.

    If the 64-bit floating-point portion of this extension is not supported,
    "GL_NV_gpu_program_fp64" will not be found in the extension string.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
