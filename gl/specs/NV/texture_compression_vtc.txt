Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 1.2.1 specification.

    ARB_texture_compression is required.

    EXT_texture_compression_s3tc is required.

    ARB_texture_non_power_of_two interacts with this extension.

Overview

    This extension adds support for the VTC 3D texture compression
    formats, which are analogous to the S3TC texture compression formats,
    with the addition of some retiling in the Z direction.  VTC has the
    same compression ratio as S3TC and uses 4x4x1, 4x4x2, (4x4x3 when
    non-power-of-two textures are supported), or 4x4x4 blocks.

Issues

    *   Should the enumerants' (1) values and (2) names be reused from
        the S3TC extension?

        RESOLVED: Yes and yes.  There is such a close correspondence
        between the formats that introducing new values or names would
        serve no purpose.

    *   Should the block alignment restrictions differ in any way from
        the block alignment restrictions in the S3TC extension?

        RESOLVED: No, except for the addition of the Z-direction block
        alignment restriction for CompressedTexSubImage3D, which is
        analogous to the X and Y restrictions.

    *   Should VTC compression work with the ARB_texture_non_power_of_two
        functionality?

        RESOLVED: Yes.  The blockIndex computation works for
        non-power-of-two width, height, and depth dimensions.

        Consider a 31x25x11 3D texture to be stored using VTC.
        The initial 31x25x8 portion of the volume is bricked up using
        VTC with 4x4x4 blocks where the 31x25 dimensions are rounded
        up to 32x28.  Following the expanded 32x28x8 initial volume are
        the final texels arranged as 32x28x3 with 4x4x3 blocks.
