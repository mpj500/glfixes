    Revision #9

Number

    336

Dependencies

    Requires GL_EXT_framebuffer_object.

    Requires GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit.

    Requires GL_EXT_framebuffer_multisample.

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 1.5 specification.

Overview

    This extension extends the EXT_framebuffer_multisample 
    specification by providing a new function,
    RenderBufferStorageMultisampleCoverageNV, that distinguishes 
    between color samples and coverage samples.

    EXT_framebuffer_multisample introduced the function 
    RenderbufferStorageMultisampleEXT as a method of defining the 
    storage parameters for a multisample render buffer.  This function 
    takes a <samples> parameter.  Using rules provided by the 
    specification, the <samples> parameter is resolved to an actual 
    number of samples that is supported by the underlying hardware.  
    EXT_framebuffer_multisample does not specify whether <samples>
    refers to coverage samples or color samples.

    This extension adds the function 
    RenderbufferStorageMultisamplCoverageNV, which takes a 
    <coverageSamples> parameter as well as a <colorSamples> parameter.  
    These two parameters give developers more fine grained control over
    the quality of multisampled images.
