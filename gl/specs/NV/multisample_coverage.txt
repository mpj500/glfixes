Overview

    The ARB_multisample extension provides a mechanism for antialiasing
    primitives.  This mechanism allows an application to request an
    additional buffer, the multisample buffer, that is added to the
    framebuffer.  An application can request the number of samples per
    fragment that are stored in the multisample buffer.  Rendering 
    proceeds by writing color, depth, and stencil values for each 
    sample to the multisample buffer.  The results are automatically
    resolved to a single displayable color each time a pixel is 
    updated.

    Coverage Sample Anti-Aliasing (CSAA) is an extension to multisample
    antialiasing.  The technique separates "samples" into two types of
    samples.  "Color samples" are samples with color, depth, and 
    stencil information stored in the multisample buffer.  "Coverage
    samples" include both color samples and additional samples that only
    provide pixel coverage information.

    This extension follows the example of the
    NV_framebuffer_multisample_coverage extension, which adds CSAA
    support for framebuffer objects.  The base description of 
    multisample rendering is written in terms of coverage samples and
    color samples.  The windows system notion of "samples"
    (SAMPLES_ARB) is layered on top of coverage and color samples.
