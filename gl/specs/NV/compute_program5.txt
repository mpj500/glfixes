Dependencies

    OpenGL 4.0 (Core or Compatibiity Profile) is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.2 Specification
    (Compatibility Profile).

    NV_gpu_program4 and NV_gpu_program5 are required.

    ARB_compute_shader is required.

    This specification interacts with NV_shader_atomic_float.

    This specification interacts with EXT_shader_image_load_store.

Overview

    This extension builds on the ARB_compute_shader extension to provide new
    assembly compute program capability for OpenGL.  ARB_compute_shader adds
    the basic functionality, including the ability to dispatch compute work.
    This extension provides the ability to write a compute program in
    assembly, using the same basic syntax and capability set found in the
    NV_gpu_program4 and NV_gpu_program5 extensions.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
