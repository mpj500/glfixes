    OpenGL Extension #459

Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 4.4 Specification, Core Profile.
    
    This extension interacts with ARB_uniform_buffer_object. 
    
    This extension interacts with NV_vertex_buffer_unified_memory. 

    This extension interacts with NV_shader_buffer_load. 

Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism to specify uniform buffers
    using GPU addresses.

    Binding uniform buffers is one of the most frequent and expensive
    operations in many GL applications, due to the cost of chasing 
    pointers and binding objects described in the overview of 
    NV_shader_buffer_load. The intent of this extension is to enable a 
    way for the application to specify uniform buffer state that alleviates
    the overhead of object binds and driver memory management.
