Dependencies

    ARB_fragment_program is required.

Overview

    This extension provides additional fragment program functionality
    to extend the standard ARB_fragment_program language and execution
    environment.  ARB programs wishing to use this added functionality
    need only add:

        OPTION NV_fragment_program;

    to the beginning of their fragment programs.

    The functionality provided by this extension, which is roughly
    equivalent to that provided by the NV_fragment_program extension,
    includes:

      * increased control over precision in arithmetic computations and
        storage,

      * data-dependent conditional writemasks,

      * an absolute value operator on scalar and swizzled operand loads,

      * instructions to compute partial derivatives, and perform texture
        lookups using specified partial derivatives,

      * fully orthogonal "set on" instructions,

      * instructions to compute reflection vector and perform a 2D
        coordinate transform, and

      * instructions to pack and unpack multiple quantities into a single
        component.

Issues

    Why is this a separate extension, rather than just an additional
    feature of NV_fragment_program?

      RESOLVED:  The NV_fragment_program specification was complete
      (with a published implementation) prior to the completion of
      ARB_fragment_program.  Future NVIDIA fragment program extensions
      should contain extensions to the ARB_fragment_program execution
      environment as a standard feature.

    Should a similar option be provided to expose ARB_fragment_program
    features not found in NV_fragment_program (e.g., state bindings,
    certain "macro" instructions) under the NV_fragment_program
    interface?

      RESOLVED:  No.  Why not just write an ARB program?

    The ARB_fragment_program spec has a minor grammar bug that requires
    that inline scalar constants used as scalar operands include a
    component selector.  In other words, you have to say "11.0.x" to
    use the constant "11.0".  What should we do here?

      RESOLVED:  The NV_fragment_program_option grammar will correct
      this problem, which should be fixed in future revisions to the
      ARB language.
