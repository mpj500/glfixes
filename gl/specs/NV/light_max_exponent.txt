Overview

    Default OpenGL does not permit a shininess or spot exponent over
    128.0.  This extension permits implementations to support and
    advertise a maximum shininess and spot exponent beyond 128.0.

    Note that extremely high exponents for shininess and/or spot light
    cutoff will require sufficiently high tessellation for acceptable
    lighting results.

    Paul Deifenbach's thesis suggests that higher exponents are
    necessary to approximate BRDFs with per-vertex ligthing and
    multiple passes.
