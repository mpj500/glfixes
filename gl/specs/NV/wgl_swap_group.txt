Dependencies

    Written based on the wording of the GLX_SGIX_swap_group and 
    GLX_SGIX_swap_barrier specifications.

    WGL_EXT_swap_control affects the definition of this extension.
    WGL_EXT_swap_frame_lock affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension provides the capability to synchronize the buffer swaps
    of a group of OpenGL windows. A swap group is created, and windows are 
    added as members to the swap group.  Buffer swaps to members of the swap 
    group will then take place concurrently.

    This extension also provides the capability to sychronize the buffer
    swaps of different swap groups, which may reside on distributed systems
    on a network. For this purpose swap groups can be bound to a swap barrier.

    This extension extends the set of conditions that must be met before
    a buffer swap can take place. 

Issues

    An implementation can not guarantee that the initialization of the swap
    groups or barriers will succeed because the state of the window system may
    restrict the usage of these features. Once a swap group or barrier has 
    been sucessfully initialized, the implementation can only guarantee to
    sustain swap group functionality as long as the state of the window system
    does not restrict this. An example for a state that does typically not
    restrict swap group usage is the use of one fullscreen sized window per
    windows desktop.
