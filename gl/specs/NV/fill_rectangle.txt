Number

    OpenGL Extension #466
    OpenGL ES Extension #232

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 Specification
    (Compatibility Profile).

    This extension interacts with OpenGL ES 3.1 (June 4, 2014)

    If implemented in OpenGL ES, NV_polygon_mode is required.

Overview

    This extension adds a new PolygonMode setting where a triangle is
    rasterized by computing and filling its axis-aligned screen-space bounding
    box, disregarding the actual triangle edges. This can be useful for
    drawing a rectangle without being split into two triangles with an
    internal edge.  It is also useful to minimize the number of primitives
    that need to be drawn, particularly for a user-interface.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

        FILL_RECTANGLE_NV                            0x933C
