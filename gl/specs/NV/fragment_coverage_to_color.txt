Number

    OpenGL Extension #467
    OpenGL ES Extension #229

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 specification
    (Compatibility Profile).

    This extension interacts with NV_multisample_coverage.

    This extension interacts with EXT_raster_multisample and 
    NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples.

    This extension interacts with OpenGL ES 3.1.

    When implemented for OpenGL ES 3.1, this extension interacts with
    OES_sample_shading.

Overview

    This extension allows the fragment coverage value, represented as an
    integer bitfield, to be substituted for a color output being written to a
    single-component color buffer with integer components (e.g., R8UI).  The
    capability provided by this extension is different from simply writing the
    gl_SampleMask fragment shader output in that the coverage value written to
    the framebuffer is taken after alpha test, stencil test, and depth test,
    as well as after the multisample fragment operations such as
    alpha-to-coverage.

    This functionality may be useful for deferred rendering algorithms, where
    the second pass needs to know which samples belong to which original 
    fragments.
