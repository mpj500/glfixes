Number

    OpenGL Extension #471
    OpenGL ES Extension #234

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 (Compatibility)
    Specification but can apply to OpenGL 1.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0 and up.

    This extension requires NV_path_rendering.

Overview

    This extension introduces a new path command modifier to the
    NV_path_rendering extension to indicate that a path command represents an
    edge (either straight or curved) that is shared with another path.

    When used in conjunction with NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples, a shared edge
    (or a whole path including shared edges) will use modified rasterization
    rules in order to ensure that groups of raster samples associated with a
    given coverage sample will all produce consistent coverage results, in
    order to avoid artifacts described further in the issues section at the
    end of this document.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
