Dependencies

    ARB_shader_atomic_counters and NV_gpu_program5 are required.

    This extension is written against the NV_gpu_program4 specification, as
    extended by NV_gpu_program5.

Overview

    This extension builds upon the ARB_shader_atomic_counters and
    NV_gpu_program5 extensions to provide assembly language support for
    incrementing, decrementing, and querying the values of atomic counters
    stored in buffer object memory.

    The extension uses the same set of atomic counter buffer binding points as
    the ARB_shader_atomic_counters extension; applications using this
    extension should use the APIs specified there to bind buffers.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
