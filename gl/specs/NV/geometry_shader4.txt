Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.

    EXT_geometry_shader4 is required.

    This extension is written against the EXT_geometry_shader4 and OpenGL 2.0
    specifications.

Overview

    This extension builds upon the EXT_geometry_shader4 specification to
    provide two additional capabilities:

        * Support for QUADS, QUAD_STRIP, and POLYGON primitive types when
          geometry shaders are enabled.  Such primitives will be tessellated
          into individual triangles.

        * Setting the value of GEOMETRY_VERTICES_OUT_EXT will take effect
          immediately.  It is not necessary to link the program object in
          order for this change to take effect, as is the case in the EXT
          version of this extension.
