Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.2 specification (Core
    Profile).

Overview

    Some applications require 3D textures that have a significant number of
    slices, but less resolution in width and height. In the current spec, the
    maximum value for the size of all three dimensions is specified by a
    single value. This extension adds a second set of limits against which 3D
    textures can be checked if an application needs deeper textures than would
    be allowed by the symmetric texture limits.
