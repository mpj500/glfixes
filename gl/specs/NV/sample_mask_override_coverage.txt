Number

    OpenGL Extension #473
    OpenGL ES Extension #236

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 specification
    (Compatibility Profile).

    This extension is written against version 4.30 of the OpenGL
    Shading Language Specification.

    This extension interacts with NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples.

    This extension interacts with NV_fragment_program4.

    This extension interacts with the OpenGL ES 3.0 and 3.1 specifications.

    If implemented in OpenGL ES 3.0 or 3.1, OES_sample_variables is required.

Overview

    This extension allows the fragment shader to control whether the
    gl_SampleMask output can enable samples that were not covered by the
    original primitive, or that failed the early depth/stencil tests.
    This can be enabled by redeclaring the gl_SampleMask output with the
    "override_coverage" layout qualifier:

        layout(override_coverage) out int gl_SampleMask[];

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
