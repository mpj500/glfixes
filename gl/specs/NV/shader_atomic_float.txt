Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.2 (Compatibility Profile)
    Specification.

    This extension is written against version 4.20 (revision 6) of the OpenGL
    Shading Language Specification.

    This extension interacts with EXT_shader_image_load_store,
    ARB_shader_image_load_store, and GLSL 4.20.

    This extension interacts with NV_shader_buffer_store and NV_gpu_shader5.

    This extension interacts with NV_gpu_program5.

    This extension interacts with EXT_shader_image_load_store and
    NV_gpu_program5.

    This extension interacts with GLSL 4.30, ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object,
    and ARB_compute_shader.

Overview

    This extension provides GLSL built-in functions and assembly opcodes
    allowing shaders to perform atomic read-modify-write operations to buffer
    or texture memory with floating-point components.  The set of atomic
    operations provided by this extension is limited to adds and exchanges.
    Providing atomic add support allows shaders to atomically accumulate the
    sum of floating-point values into buffer or texture memory across multiple
    (possibly concurrent) shader invocations.

    This extension provides GLSL support for atomics targeting image uniforms
    (if GLSL 4.20, ARB_shader_image_load_store, or EXT_shader_image_load_store
    is supported) or floating-point pointers (if NV_gpu_shader5 is supported).
    Additionally, assembly opcodes for these operations is also provided if
    NV_gpu_program5 is supported.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
