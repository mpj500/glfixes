Overview

    This extension provides a method for GL to read, store and optionally
    process textures that are defined in Y'CbCr 422 video formats.  This
    extension supports the two common Y'CbCr 422 video formats (known by
    QuickTime FourCC as '2vuy' and 'yuvs'). These formats represent one of the
    most common 16 bit Y'CbCr formats in both standard and reverse byte
    ordering. From a client stand point these can be assumed to be decoded
    immediately (even though the implementation is free to optimize the data
    storage and keep it in the native format) and otherwise function as any
    other texture format.  The texture command <internalformat> parameter
    normally be should be specified as RGB, since Y'CbCr is just a form of RGB
    data.  This extension can be supported with either hardware or software
    decoding and it is up to the specific implementation to determine which is
    used.

    A new <format> is added, YCBCR_422_APPLE.  Additionally, to handle the
    difference in pixel size and byte ordering for 422 video, the pixel storage
    operations treat YCBCR_422_APPLE as a 2 component format using
    the UNSIGNED_SHORT_8_8_APPLE or UNSIGNED_SHORT_8_8_REV_APPLE <type>.

    The '2vuy' or k2vuyPixelFormat pixel format is an 8-bit 4:2:2 Component
    Y'CbCr format. Each 16 bit pixel is represented by an unsigned eight bit
    luminance component and two unsigned eight bit chroma components. Each pair
    of pixels shares a common set of chroma values. The components are ordered
    in memory; Cb, Y0, Cr, Y1. The luminance components have a range of [16,
    235], while the chroma value has a range of [16, 240]. This is consistent
    with the CCIR601 spec. This format is fairly prevalent on both Mac and Win32
    platforms. The equivalent Microsoft fourCC is ÔUYVYÕ.  This format is
    supported with the UNSIGNED_SHORT_8_8_REV_APPLE type for pixel storage
    operations.

    The 'yuvs' or kYUVSPixelFormat is an 8-bit 4:2:2 Component Y'CbCr format.
    Identical to the k2vuyPixelFormat except each 16 bit word has been byte
    swapped. This results in a component ordering of; Y0, Cb, Y1, Cr. This is
    most prevalent yuv 4:2:2 format on both Mac and Win32 platforms. The
    equivalent Microsoft fourCC is 'YUY2'.  This format is supported with the
    UNSIGNED_SHORT_8_8_APPLE type for pixel storage operations.

Issues

	Why is YCRCR_422 not provided as an <internalformat>?

		The internalFormat parameter passes two distinct pieces of information:
		which one of the six texEnv equations to use *and* what the desired
		internal storage format is.  All of the existing internal format enums
		have one of {RGBA, RGB, L, LA, A, I} embedded in the name to specify
		which of the six texEnv equations.  Since the YUV data contains RGB
		information, only the RGB texEnv setting is meaningful.  Thus, if we did
		provide a new internal format enum it would have to be something of the
		form GL_RGB_YCRCR422 (weird, but has the right meaning).  Using
		YCRCR_422 as an internalFormat setting would be incorrect with respect
		to the texEnv equations.
