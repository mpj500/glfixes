Overview

    The transform_hint extension provides a new target,
    TRANSFORM_HINT_APPLE, for the Hint procedure.  When the
    transform hint is set to FASTEST the GL may choose to 
    implement certain state dependent algebraic simplifications
    in the geometry transformation that affect the sub-pixel
    precision of the transformed vertex coordinates.  

    For example, if two polygons are rendered with identical object
    coordinates, different GL state settings, and the transform
    hint set to FASTEST, there is no gaurantee that the resulting 
    window coordinates of the two polygons will be precisely
    identical.  Therefore, precise tests of the window coordinates, 
    such as a depth test setting of EQUAL, should not be used.

    If the transform hint is set to NICEST or DONT_CARE, two polygons
    with identical object coordinates will always be transformed
    to identical window coordinates.
