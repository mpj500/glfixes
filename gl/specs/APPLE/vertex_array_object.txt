Overview

    This extension introduces named vertex array objects which encapsulate
    vertex array state on the client side. The main purpose of these 
    objects is to keep pointers to static vertex data and provide a name 
    for different sets of static vertex data.  
    
    By extending vertex array range functionality this extension allows multiple
    vertex array ranges to exist at one time, including their complete sets of
    state, in manner analogous to texture objects. 
    
    GenVertexArraysAPPLE creates a list of n number of vertex array object
    names.  After creating a name, BindVertexArrayAPPLE associates the name with
    a vertex array object and selects this vertex array and its associated
    state as current.  To get back to the default vertex array and its
    associated state the client should bind to vertex array named 0.

    Once a client is done using a vertex array object it can be deleted with
    DeleteVertexArraysAPPLE.  The client is responsible for allocating and
    deallocating the memory used by the vertex array data, while the
    DeleteVertexArraysAPPLE command deletes vertex array object names and
    associated state only.
