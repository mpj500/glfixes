Dependencies

    Buffer Objects as per ARB_vertex_buffer_object or OpenGL 1.5 are required.

    If ARB_pixel_buffer_object is NOT supported and the OpenGL version is less
    than 2.1, ignore references to PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER and PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER.

    If APPLE_fence or similar fencing mechanism is NOT suppported, Finish can
    be used in place of TestObject, FinishObject, TestFence and FinishFence.

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL 2.1 specification.
