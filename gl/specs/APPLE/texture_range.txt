Overview

    This extension provides a method to specify the range of client address
    space that may be used by a texture.  In general, the storage size of a
    texture may be easily determined by the texture's data type and geometry.
    However, driver optimizations may be realized if an extended address
    range is specified to encompass the storage of multiple textures, or to
    encompass potential future changes in the size of a texture.  A typical
    usage of this extension is to specify an identical address range for
    several textures in a particular working set that encompasses the storage
    of all the textures in the set.  This allows the driver to make a single
    memory mapping for all of the textures.

    Further, a mechanism is provided to allow the application to give the GL
    driver a hint regarding the storage requirements of the texture data.
