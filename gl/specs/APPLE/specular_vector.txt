Overview

    An alternative specular lighting model is enabled by passing
    the LIGHT_MODEL_SPECULAR_VECTOR token as the <pname> parameter
    to LightModel, and TRUE as the <param> parameter.  The specular
    vector lighting model calculates the specular intensity as the
    dot product of the true reflection vector of the light source
    and the vector from the vertex to the viewpoint.  This yields
    results that are visually similar to but often more realistic
    than the existing lighting model.  

    Mathematically, the specular component s.n in the existing
    lighting model calculation is replaced with the following
    alternative calculation.

    Given three vectors, n, l, and p, where n is the unit normal
    vector at the vertex, l is the unit vector from the vertex to
    the light position, and p is the unit vector from the vertex
    to the viewpoint (or the vector {0,0,1} if
    LIGHT_MODEL_LOCAL_VIEWER is false), the specular component is
    given by

      (2 * cross(n, cross(n, l)) + l) . p

    All other lighting model and material parameters (shininess,
    spotlight, attenuation, local viewer, and direction/positional
    sources) operate normally.  The specular vector lighting model
    affects both rgba and index modes.
