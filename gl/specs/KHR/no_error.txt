Status

    Complete.
    Approved by the Khronos Board of Promoters on May 8, 2015.

Version

    Version 6, February 25, 2015

Number

    ARB Extension #175
    OpenGL ES Extension #243

Dependencies

    Requires OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL 2.0.

    Written against the OpenGL ES 3.1 specification.

    Interacts with EGL_KHR_create_context_no_error (or equivalent) extension.

    CONTEXT_FLAG_NO_ERROR_BIT_KHR is only supported if the OpenGL version has
    support for context flags (as defined in the OpenGL 4.5 core spec) or an
    extension supporting equivalent functionality is exposed.

Overview

    With this extension enabled any behavior that generates a GL error will
    have undefined behavior.  The reason this extension exists is performance
    can be increased and power usage decreased.  When this mode is used, a GL
    driver can have undefined behavior where it would have generated a GL error
    without this extension.  This could include application termination.  In
    general this extension should be used after you have verified all the GL
    errors are removed, and an application is not the kind that would check
    for GL errors and adjust behavior based on those errors.
