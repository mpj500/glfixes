Dependencies

    EXT_texture_env_combine is required by this extension.
    ARB_multitexture is required by this extension.

Overview

    This extension adds environment mapped bump mapping (EMBM) to the GL.
    The method exposed by this extension is to use a dependent texture
    read on a bumpmap (du,dv) texture to offset the texture coordinates
    read into a map on another texture unit.  This (du,dv) offset is also 
    rotated through a user-specified rotation matrix to get the texture 
    coordinates into the appropriate space.

    A new texture format is introduced in order for specifying the (du,dv)
    bumpmap texture.  This map represents -1 <= du,dv <= 1 offsets to
    be applied to the texture coordinates used to read into the base
    map.  Additionally, the (du,dv) offsets are transformed by a rotation
    matrix that this extension allows the user to specify.  Further, a 
    new color operation is added to EXT_texture_env_combine to specify 
    both that bumpmapping is enabled and which texture unit to apply 
    the bump offset to.
