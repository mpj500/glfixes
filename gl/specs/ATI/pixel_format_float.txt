Dependencies

    WGL_ARB_pixel_format is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.


Overview

    This extension adds pixel formats with floating-point RGBA color
    components.

    The size of each float components is specified using the same
    WGL_RED_BITS_ARB, WGL_GREEN_BITS_ARB, WGL_BLUE_BITS_ARB and
    WGL_ALPHA_BITS_ARB pixel format attributes that are used for
    defining the size of fixed-point components.  32 bit floating-
    point components are in the standard IEEE float format.  16 bit
    floating-point components have 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits,
    and 10 mantissa bits. 

    In standard OpenGL RGBA color components are normally clamped to
    the range [0,1].  The color components of a float buffer are
    clamped to the limits of the range representable by their format.


Issues

    1. Should we expose a GL_FLOAT16_ATI pixel type?

       RESOLUTION:  This will be exposed in a separate extension.
