Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification.
    OpenGL 1.1 is required. ATI_vertex_array_object is required by
    this extension. 

    
Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism for an application to obtain
    the virtual address of an object buffer. This allows the
    application to directly update the contents of an object buffer
    and avoid any intermediate copies.

    
Issues

    Should we use Lock and Unlock terminology?
    
	UNRESOLVED: This could be confusing. D3D uses "Lock" to mean
 	that something is available for the application to update and
 	won't be changed by the driver. However, in the compiled
 	vertex array extension, "Lock" is used to mean that the
 	application will not be changing the contents of a vertex
 	buffer.
