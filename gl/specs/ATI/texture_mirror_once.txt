Overview

    ATI_texture_mirror_once extends the set of texture wrap modes to 
    include two modes (GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_ATI, GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE_ATI) 
    that effectively use a texture map twice as large as the original image 
    in which the additional half of the new image is a mirror image of the 
    original image.

    This new mode relaxes the need to generate images whose opposite edges
    match by using the original image to generate a matching "mirror image".
    This mode allows the texture to be mirrored only once in the negative
    s, t, and r directions.
