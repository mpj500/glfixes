Dependencies

    ARB_vertex_program and EXT_vertex_shader affect the definition of 
    this extension.

Overview

    ATI_pn_triangles provides a path for enabling the GL to internally 
    tessellate input geometry into curved patches.  The extension allows the 
    user to tune the amount of tessellation to be performed on each triangle as 
    a global state value.  The intent of PN Triangle tessellation is 
    typically to produce geometry with a smoother silhouette and more organic 
    shape.

    The tessellated patch will replace the triangles input into the GL.  
    The GL will generate new vertices in object-space, prior to geometry 
    transformation.  Only the vertices and normals are required to produce 
    proper results, and the rest of the information per vertex is interpolated 
    linearly across the patch.  

Issues

    (1) Should this extension mandate the algorithm used to perform 
        tessellation?
	
        RESOLVED: Yes, both for performance and so that the resultant 
        geometry is consistent across implementations.

    (2) What geometry modes will be supported for tessellation besides 
        TRIANGLE based primitives? 

        RESOLVED: None, only triangle based primitives: triangles, fans, 
        and strips.

    (3) How does this extension interact with the EXT_vertex_shader and 
        ARB_vertex_program programmable vertex shader extensions?

        RESOLVED: The PN Triangle tessellation algorithm requires the 
        presence of both vertex position and normal.  Therefore, if an 
        application enables PN Triangle tessellation and has a programmable 
        vertex shader enabled, that shader should export the fixed-function 
        equivalent of position and normal.  If the shader does not export
        either the position or normal, then the results of PN Triangle
        tessellation are undefined.
