Dependencies

    ARB_multitexture is required by this extension.

    ARB_shadow interacts with this extension.

    ARB_vertex_program is referred to for documentation on the
    program management API, but not specifically required as long
    as the entry points are exported by this extension.

    ATI_fragment_shader is the architectural basis for this extension,
    but is not specifically required by this extension.

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

    NOTE: Though this extension introduces no new procedures and
    functions, it relies on the program object management API from the
    pending ARB_vertex_program extension with the introduction of
    a new program target and program specification syntax.
    See the ARB_vertex_program specification for full details on the
    use of these procedures and functions.
