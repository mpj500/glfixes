Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required. 

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 Specification.

    The extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language V 1.20
    Specification.

    This extension interacts with EXT_texture_anisotropic.


Overview

    This extension adds new shading language built-in texture functions
    to the shading language.

    These texture functions may be used to access one component textures.

    The texture4 built-in function returns a texture value derived from
    a 2x2 set of texels in the image array of level levelbase is selected.
    These texels are selected in the same way as when the value of
    TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is LINEAR, but instead of these texels being
    filtered to generate the texture value, the R, G, B and A texture values
    are derived directly from these four texels.
