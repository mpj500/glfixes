Dependencies

    OpenGL 2.0 or ARB_shader_objects is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language
    Specification, Version 4.30.

Overview

    This extension introduces three new trinary built-in functions to the
    OpenGL Shading Languages. These functions allow the minimum, maximum
    or median of three inputs to be found with a single function call. These
    operations may be useful for sorting and filtering operations, for example.
    By explicitly performing a trinary operation with a single built-in
    function, shader compilers and optimizers may be able to generate better
    instruction sequences for perform sorting and other multi-input functions.
