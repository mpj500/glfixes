Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.0 is required.

    The definition of this extension is affected by EXT_stencil_wrap and
    OpenGL 2.0.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Specification, Version 4.2
    (Core Profile).

Overview

    Stencil buffers are special buffers that allow tests to be made against an
    incoming value and action taken based on that value. The stencil buffer is
    updated during rasterization, and the operation used to update the stencil
    buffer is chosen based on whether the fragment passes the stencil test,
    and if it does, whether it passes the depth test. Traditional OpenGL
    includes support for several primitive operations, such as incrementing,
    or clearing the content of the stencil buffer, or replacing it with a
    specified reference value.

    This extension adds support for an additional set of operations that may
    be performed on the stencil buffer under each circumstance. Additionally,
    this extension separates the value used as the source for stencil
    operations from the reference value, allowing different values to be used
    in the stencil test, and in the update of the stencil buffer.

IP Status

    None.
