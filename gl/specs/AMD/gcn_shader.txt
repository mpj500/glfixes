    OpenGL Extension #453

Dependencies

    This extension is written against Revision 8 of the version 4.40 of the
    OpenGL Shading Language Specification, dated January 22, 2014.

    This extension builds upon features introduced by the
    GL_ARB_shader_group_vote extension.

    AMD_gpu_shader_int64 or NV_gpu_shader5 is required.

Overview

    This extension exposes miscellaneous features of the AMD "Graphics Core
    Next" shader architecture that do not cleanly fit into other extensions
    and are not significant enough alone to warrant their own extensions.
    This includes cross-SIMD lane ballots, cube map query functions and
    a functionality to query the elapsed shader core time.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
