Dependencies

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 4.1 (Core) Specification.

Overview

    The extension ARB_depth_clamp introduced the ability to control
    the clamping of the depth value for both the near and far plane.
    One limitation is that the control was for both planes at the
    same time; some applications can benefit from having clamping
    enabled for only one of the two planes, in order to save
    fillrate for the other plane by clipping the geometry.

    This extension provides exactly such functionality.
