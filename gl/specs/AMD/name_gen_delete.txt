Overview

    This extension simply creates 2 new entry-points that name generic
    creation and deletion of names.  The intent is to go away from API
    functionality that provides a create/delete function for each specific 
    object.  

    For example: 
        glGenTextures/glDeleteTextures/glIsTexture
        glGenBuffers/glDeleteBuffers/IsBuffer
        glGenFramebuffers/glDeleteFramebuffers/IsFramebuffer

    Instead, everything is created using one entry-point GenNamesAMD and
    everything is now deleted with another entry-point DeleteNamesAMD with
    the appropriate identifier set.  In addition, everything can now be 
    queried with IsNameAMD.

    This alleviates the problem we may eventually encounter where we have
    many Gen/Delete/Is functions where 3 might suffice.  All that is needed
    in the new case is to add a valid identifier to the accepted parameters
    list.
