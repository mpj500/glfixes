Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.

    ARB_texture_cube_map is required.

    ARB_seamless_cube_map affects the definition of this extension.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 1.5 Specification.

Overview

    In unextended OpenGL, cube maps are treated as sets of six, independent
    texture images. Once a face is selected from the set, it is treated exactly
    as any other two-dimensional texture would be. When sampling linearly from
    the texture, all of the individual texels that would be used to to create
    the final, bilinear sample values are taken from the same cube face. The
    normal, two-dimensional texture coordinate wrapping modes are honored.
    This sometimes causes seams to appear in cube maps.

    ARB_seamless_cube_map addresses this issue by providing a mechanism whereby
    an implementation could take each of the taps of a bilinear sample from
    a different face, spanning face boundaries and providing seamless filtering
    from cube map textures. However, in ARB_seamless_cube_map, this feature was
    exposed as a global state, affecting all bound cube map textures. It was not
    possible to mix seamless and per-face cube map sampling modes during
    multisampling. Furthermore, if an application included cube maps that were
    meant to be sampled seamlessly and non-seamlessly, it would have to track
    this state and enable or disable seamless cube map sampling as needed.

    This extension addresses this issue and provides an orthogonal method for
    allowing an implementation to provide a per-texture setting for enabling
    seamless sampling from cube maps.
