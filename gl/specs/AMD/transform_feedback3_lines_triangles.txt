Dependencies

    OpenGL 4.0 or ARB_transform_feedback3 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.0 (Core) Specification.

Overview

    OpenGL 4.0 introduced the ability to record primitives into multiple output
    streams using transform feedback. However, the restriction that all streams
    must output POINT primitives when more than one output stream is active was
    also introduced. This extension simply removes that restriction, allowing
    the same set of primitives to be used with multiple transform feedback
    streams as with a single stream.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
