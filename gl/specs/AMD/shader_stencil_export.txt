    ARB_fragment_shader is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
    version 1.40.05

Overview

    In OpenGL, the stencil test is a powerful mechanism to selectively discard
    fragments based on the content of the stencil buffer. However, facilites
    to update the content of the stencil buffer are limited to operations such
    as incrementing the existing value, or overwriting with a fixed reference
    value.

    This extension provides a mechanism whereby a shader may generate the
    stencil reference value per invocation. When stencil testing is enabled,
    this allows the test to be performed against the value generated in the
    shader. When the stencil operation is set to GL_REPLACE, this allows a
    value generated in the shader to be written to the stencil buffer directly.
