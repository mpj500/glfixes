    dated August 8, 2011.

Overview

    This extension defines an interface that allows improved control
    of the physical memory used by the graphics device.

    It allows an existing page of system memory allocated by the application
    to be used as memory directly accessible to the graphics processor. One
    example application of this functionality would be to be able to avoid an
    explicit synchronous copy with sub-system of the application; for instance
    it is possible to directly draw from a system memory copy of a video
    image.
