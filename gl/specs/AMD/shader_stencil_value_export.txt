Number

    OpenGL Extension #444

Dependencies

    OpenGL 2.0 or ARB_fragment_shader is required.

    The AMD_shader_stencil_export extension affects the definition of this
    extension.

    The AMD_stencil_operation_extended extension is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)
    Specification, Version 4.00.7.

Overview

    OpenGL includes stencil testing functionality that allows an application
    specified value (the reference value) to be compared against the content
    of a stencil buffer and fragments kept or discarded based on the results
    of this test. In addition to updating the stencil buffer with simple
    operations such as inversion or incrementation, this reference value may be
    written directly into the stencil buffer.

        AMD_stencil_operation_extended further extended the number of
    operations that may be performed on the stencil buffer to include logical
    and arithmetic operations. It also introduced new state, the stencil
    operation source value, to allow these new operations to be performed on
    the stencil buffer using an application supplied constant value as a source
    value, rather than the reference value used in the stencil test.

        The AMD_shader_stencil_export extension allowed the reference value
    used for the stencil test to be generated and exported from a fragment
    shader. This extension provides similar functionality for the stencil
    operation source value, allowing it to be generated in and exported from
    the fragment shader too.
