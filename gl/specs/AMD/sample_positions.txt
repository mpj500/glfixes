Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.

    EXT_framebuffer_multisample or OpenGL 3.2 is required.

    This extension interacts with the ARB_texture_multisample extension.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 3.2 (Core) specification.

Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism to explicitly set sample positions for a
    FBO with multi-sampled attachments. The FBO will use identical sample locations
    for all pixels in each attachment. This forces TEXTURE_FIXED_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS
    to TRUE if a multi-sampled texture is specified using TexImage2DMultisample
    or TexImage3DMultisample. That is, using GetTexLevelParameter to query
    TEXTURE_FIXED_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS will always return TRUE if the mechanism is
    explicitly used to set the sample positions.
