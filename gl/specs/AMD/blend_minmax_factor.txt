Dependencies

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 4.1 (Core) Specification.

    OpenGL 1.0 is required.

Overview

    The EXT_blend_minmax extension extended the GL's blending functionality
    to allow the blending equation to be specified by the application. That
    extension introduced the MIN_EXT and MAX_EXT blend equations, which caused the
    result of the blend equation to become the minimum or maximum of the source
    color and destination color, respectively.

    The MIN_EXT and MAX_EXT blend equations, however, do not include the source
    or destination blend factors in the arguments to the min and max functions.
    This extension provides two new blend equations that produce the minimum
    or maximum of the products of the source color and source factor, and the
    destination color and destination factor.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
