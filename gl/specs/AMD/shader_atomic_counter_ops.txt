Number

    OpenGL Extension #435

Dependencies

    OpenGL 4.2 or ARB_shader_atomic_counters is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.3 (core) specification
    and the GLSL 4.30.7 specification.

Overview

    The ARB_shader_atomic_counters extension introduced atomic counters, but
    it limits list of potential operations that can be performed on them to
    increment, decrement, and query. This extension extends the list of GLSL
    built-in functions that can operate on atomic counters. The list of new
    operations include:

      * Increment and decrement with wrap
      * Addition and subtraction
      * Minimum and maximum
      * Bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, etc.)
      * Masked OR operator
      * Exchange, and compare and exchange operators

New Procedures and Functions

    None.
