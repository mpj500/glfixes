Dependencies

    OpenGL 4.0 or ARB_draw_indirect is required.

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 4.1 Specification, Core Profile,
    July 25, 2010

Overview

    The ARB_draw_indirect extension (included in OpenGL 4.0) introduced
    mechanisms whereby the parameters for a draw function may be provided in
    a structure contained in a buffer object rather than as parameters to the
    drawing procedure. This is known as an indirect draw and is exposed as two
    new functions, glDrawArraysIndirect and glDrawElementsIndirect. Each of
    these functions generates a single batch of primitives.

    This extension builds on this functionality by providing procedures to
    invoke multiple draws from a single procedure call. This allows large
    batches of drawing commands to be assembled in server memory (via a buffer
    object) which may then be dispatched through a single function call.
