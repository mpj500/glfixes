Dependencies

    OpenGL 4.1 or ARB_viewport_array is required.

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 4.2 Specification, Core Profile,
    January 19, 2011 and the OpenGL Shading Language Specification,
    version 4.20.11.

Overview

    The gl_ViewportIndex built-in variable was introduced by the
    ARB_viewport_array extension and OpenGL 4.1. This variable is available
    in un-extended OpenGL only to the geometry shader. When written in the
    geometry shader, it causes geometry to be directed to one of an array
    of several independent viewport rectangles.

    In order to use any viewport other than zero, a geometry shader must be
    present. Geometry shaders introduce processing overhead and potential
    performance issues. This extension exposes the gl_ViewportIndex built-in
    variable to the vertex shader, allowing the functionality introduced by
    ARB_viewport_array to be accessed without requiring a geometry shader to
    be present.
