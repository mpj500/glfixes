Status
    Draft.

Version
    Last Modified Date: June 5, 2012
    Author Revision: 1

Number

    429

Dependencies
    OpenGL 3.0 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.2 Specification
    compatibility profile.

Overview
    Systems with integrated GPUs can share the same physical memory between CPU
    and GPU. This feature, if exposed by API, can bring significant performance
    benefits for graphics applications by reducing the complexity of
    uploading/accessing texture contents. This extension enables CPU direct
    access to the GPU memory holding textures.

    The problem with texture memory directly exposed to clients is that
    textures are often 'tiled'. Texels are kept in specific layout to improve
    locality of reference and thus performance of texturing. This 'tiling'
    is specific to particular hardware and would be thus difficult to use.

    This extension allows to create textures with 'linear' layout which allows
    for simplified access on user side (potentially sacrificing some
    performance during texture sampling).

New Procedures and Functions

    void* MapTexture2DINTEL(uint texture, int level, bitfield access,
                            int *stride, enum *layout);

    void UnmapTexture2DINTEL(uint texture, int level);

    void SyncTextureINTEL(uint texture);
