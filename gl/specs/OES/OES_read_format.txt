Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #17 (formerly OpenGL Extension #295)

Dependencies

    None
    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.

Overview

    This extension provides the capability to query an OpenGL
    implementation for a preferred type and format combination
    for use with reading the color buffer with the ReadPixels
    command.  The purpose is to enable embedded implementations
    to support a greatly reduced set of type/format combinations
    and provide a mechanism for applications to determine which
    implementation-specific combination is supported.

    The preferred type and format combination returned may depend
    on the read surface bound to the current GL context.

Issues

*   Should this be generalized for other commands: DrawPixels, TexImage?

    Resolved: No need to aggrandize.
