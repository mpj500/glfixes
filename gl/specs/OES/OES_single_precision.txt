Version

    Version 1, September 18, 2014

Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #18 (formerly OpenGL Extension #293)

Dependencies

    None
    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.

Overview

    This extension adds commands with single-precision floating-point
    parameters corresponding to the commands that only variants that
    accept double-precision floating-point input.  This allows an
    application to avoid using double-precision floating-point
    data types.  New commands are added with an 'f' prefix.

Issues

*   An alternative is to suggest platforms define GLfloat and
    GLdouble to be the same type, since it is unlikely that both
    single- and double-precision are required at the same time.

    Resolved: This might create additional confusion, so it is
    better to define new commands.

New Procedures and Functions

    void DepthRangefOES(clampf n, clampf f);
    void FrustumfOES(float l, float r, float b, float t, float n, float f);
    void OrthofOES(float l, float r, float b, float t, float n, float f);

    void ClipPlanefOES(enum plane, const float* equation);
    void GetClipPlanefOES(enum plane, float* equation);

    void glClearDepthfOES(clampf depth);
