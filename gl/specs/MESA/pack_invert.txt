Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.0 or later is required
    This extensions is written against the OpenGL 1.4 Specification.

Overview

    This extension adds a new pixel storage parameter to indicate that
    images are to be packed in top-to-bottom order instead of OpenGL's
    conventional bottom-to-top order.  Only pixel packing can be
    inverted (i.e. for glReadPixels, glGetTexImage, glGetConvolutionFilter,
    etc).

    Almost all known image file formats store images in top-to-bottom
    order.  As it is, OpenGL reads images from the frame buffer in
    bottom-to-top order.  Thus, images usually have to be inverted before
    writing them to a file with image I/O libraries.  This extension
    allows images to be read such that inverting isn't needed.

Issues

    1. Should we also defined UNPACK_INVERT_MESA for glDrawPixels, etc?

    Resolved:  No, we're only concerned with pixel packing.  There are other
    solutions for inverting images when using glDrawPixels (negative Y pixel
    zoom) or glTexImage (invert the vertex T coordinates).  It would be easy
    enough to define a complementary extension for pixel packing in the
    future if needed.
