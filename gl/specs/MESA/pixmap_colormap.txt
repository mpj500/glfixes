Overview

    Since Mesa allows RGB rendering into drawables with PseudoColor,
    StaticColor, GrayScale and StaticGray visuals, Mesa needs a colormap
    in order to compute pixel values during rendering.

    The colormap associated with a window can be queried with normal
    Xlib functions but there is no colormap associated with pixmaps.

    The glXCreateGLXPixmapMESA function is an alternative to glXCreateGLXPixmap
    which allows specification of a colormap.

IP Status

    Open-source; freely implementable.

Issues

    None.
