Overview

    Mesa's implementation of GLX is entirely implemented on the client side.
    Therefore, Mesa cannot immediately detect when an X window or pixmap is
    destroyed in order to free any ancilliary data associated with the window
    or pixmap.

    The glxMesaReleaseBuffers() function can be used to explicitly indicate
    when the back color buffer, depth buffer, stencil buffer, and/or accum-
    ulation buffer associated with a drawable can be freed.

IP Status

    Open-source; freely implementable.

    None.
