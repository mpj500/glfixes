Overview

    This extension provides the capability to sychronize the buffer
    swaps of different swap groups.

    A swap group is bound to a _swap_barrier_.  The buffer swaps of each 
    swap group using that barrier will wait until every swap group using 
    that barrier is ready to swap (where readiness is defined below), after
    which time all buffer swaps of all groups using that barrier will
    take place concurrently.

    This extension extends the set of conditions that must be met before
    a buffer swap can take place. 

Issues

    * Should we have a query for the maximum number of supported barriers?
