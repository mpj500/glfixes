Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.1 is required.
    EXT_light_texture is required.
    SGIS_multitexture affects the definition of this extension.
    SGIX_color_range affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension defines a general mechanism for substituting the
    fragment color computed during texture environment processing in
    place of fog fragment attributes such as fog color, fog density
    fog patchy factor. The application of texture to fog color assumes
    no internal format constraint of the image. Fog density and patchy
    multiplicative factor are scalar values and are substituted
    by the red texture component.

IP Status

    Silicon Graphics has filed for patent protection for some of the
    techniques described in this extension document.

Issues:

    * This extension is incomplete with respect to the dependency
    of the fog_patchy extension

    * The fog patchy factor is expected to be a constant of 1.
    unless is applied by a texture. Is that the most intuitive
    api. Should we support a any constant for the factor and have
    it be set as a fog parameter (in glFog).
