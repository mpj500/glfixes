Dependencies

    EXT_blend_minmax is required
    EXT_blend_subtract affects the number of values of BLEND_EQUATION_EXT

Overview

    Two additional blending equations are specified using the interface
    defined by EXT_blend_minmax.  These equations are similar to the
    MIN_EXT and MAX_EXT blending equations, but the outcome for all four
    color components is determined by a comparison of just the alpha
    component's source and destination values.  These equations are useful
    in image processing and advanced shading algorithms.
