Overview

    This extension provides a additional way to rasterize geometric
    primitives and pixel rectangles.  The techique is to reduce the
    number of pixels rasterized  and (possibly) the number of depth and
    stencil operations performed per primitive.  Each pixel is zoomed
    up and used to render an N x N block of screen pixels.  The
    implementation is free to choose the number of stencil and z pixels
    that will correspond to each N x N block.

    This extension provides an opportunity to the implementation to
    perform expensive raster operations at a reduced resolution,
    increasing performance.  Such operations may include
    texture-mapping, depth & stencil tests, etc.  The hardware should
    be allowed to perform operations that it accelerates at full
    hardware speed.

    The visual result will be the same as if a scene were rendered into
    a small window, and then that buffer was copied and zoomed up into
    a large window.

    All OpenGL parameters that effect rasterization size will implicitly
    be multipled by N (this includes point size, line width, etc).

Issues

    * What happens with zoomed (polygon/line) stippled pattern?
