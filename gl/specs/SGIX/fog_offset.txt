Dependencies

    OpenGL 1.0 is required.
    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification.

Overview

    This extension allows fragments to look brighter in a foggy
    environment, by biasing the fragment eye-coordinate distance prior
    to fog computation. A reference point in eye space (rx ry rz) and an offset
    amount toward the viewpoint (f_o) are specified. When fog offset is
    enabled, the offset amount will be subtracted from the fragment
    distance, making objects appear less foggy.

    If fog computation is done in screen-space coordinates under
    perspective projection, the reference point is used in adjusting the
    fog offset to be correct for fragments whose depth is close to that
    point. The reference point should be redefined when it becomes too
    far away from the primitives being drawn. Under orthographic
    projection, or if fog computation is done in eye-space coordinates,
    the reference point is ignored.
