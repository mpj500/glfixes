Overview

    This extension defines a new depth texture format.  An important
    application of depth texture images is shadow casting, but separating
    this from the shadow extension allows for the potential use of depth
    textures in other applications such as image-based rendering or
    displacement mapping.  This extension does not define new depth-texture
    environment functions, such as filtering or applying the depth values
    computed from a texture, but leaves this to other extensions, such as
    the shadow extension.
