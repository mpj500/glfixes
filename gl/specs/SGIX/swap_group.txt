Overview

    This extension provides the capability to synchronize the buffer swaps
    of a group of GLX drawables.  A swap group is created, and drawables are 
    added as members to the swap group.  Buffer swaps to members of the swap 
    group will then take place concurrently.

    This extension extends the set of conditions that must be met before
    a buffer swap can take place.
