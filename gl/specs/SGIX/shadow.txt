Overview

        This extension defines two new operations to be performed on texture
        values before they are passed on to the filtering subsystem.  These
        operations perform either a <= or >= test on the value from texture
        memory and the iterated R value, and return 1.0 or 0.0 if the test
        passes or fails, respectively.
