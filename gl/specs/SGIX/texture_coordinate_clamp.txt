Dependencies

    EXT_texture3D affects the definition of this extension

Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism to specify the maximum texture coordinate
    clamping values. Standard OpenGL always clamps the upper bound to 1.0 when
    the wrap mode is set to CLAMP. This mechanism can be used to  guarantee 
    that non-existent texel data will not be accessed when the texture image has 
    dimensions that are not a power of 2.

Issues

    *	What is the effect of wrap modes?
        -- This mode is only effective when the wrap mode is set to clamp
    
    *   Are border modes supported?
	-- Border modes are independent of texture coordinate clamping. Borders
	   live outside the 0.0 to 1.0 texture coordinate range. However, a
	   particular filtering method may access texels beyond the clamped
	   values. It is the users responsibility to ensure that adequate
	   texels are defined or to set the border mode to CLAMP_TO_EDGE_SGIS
	   to prevent access outside this range. The texel value used past
	   the clamped edge is otherwise undefined.

    *   Can defining the clamp values before the texture is defined be used to
	allocate less texture memory for the texture?
	-- Maybe. This is an implementation issue that the hardware may or may
	   not take advantage of. However, the clamp value may be increased
	   later to download data into a larger region.
    
    *   Does subloading a texture image to a region outside the clamped area 
	preserve the contents in the outside area?
	-- Yes. Downloading texels outside the clamped region should make the 
	   data be preserved. 

    *   Only the upper limit of the clamp region may be specified. Might 
	other more generic needs be met by allowing both min and max to be 
	defined? For example, you could define a large texture of smaller 
	"tiles" that could be selected for various surfaces.
	-- Intel has a pending spec to do texture clipping. This is somewhat
	   similar to what is mentioned above. This extension defines a 
	   mechanism to clamp and also provides a hint to the size of the
	   texture to be allocated.

    *   Since wrapped textures aren't supported, the only real functionality
	this appears to add is when the geometry (s,t,r) ranges are not 
	aligned with or matching the (x,y,z) ranges. For example, mapping 
	video to a sphere.  Is this correct? Otherwise, one could just define
	a rectangle with the right (s,t) ranges.
	-- Yes. However that does not provide OpenGL any hint as to the size
	   of texture that actually needs to be allocated.
