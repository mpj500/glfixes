Overview

    This extension provides a way to interlace rows of pixels when
    rasterizing pixel rectangles, and loading texture images.  In this
    context, interlacing means skiping over rows of pixels or texels
    in the destination.  This is useful for dealing with video data
    since a single frame of video is typically composed from two images
    or fields: one image specifying the data for even rows of the frame
    and the other image specifying the data for odd rows of the frame.

New Procedures and Functions
