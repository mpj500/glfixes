Overview

    This extension introduces a new asynchronous mode for texture
    download, pixel download and pixel readback commands.  It allows
    programs to transfer textures or images between the host and the
    graphics accelerator in parallel with the execution of other
    graphics commands (possibly taking advantage of a secondary path
    to the graphics accelerator).  It also allows programs to issue
    non-blocking pixel readback commands that return immediately after
    they are issued so that the program can issue other commands while
    the readback takes place.

New Procedures and Functions
