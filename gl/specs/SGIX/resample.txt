Overview

	This extension enhances the unpacking resampling capabilities
	of the SGIX_subsample extension.

	When pixel data is received from the client and an unpacking
	upsampling mode other than PIXEL_SUBSAMPLE_RATE_4444_SGIX is
	specified, the upsampling is performed via one of two methods:
	RESAMPLE_REPLICATE_SGIX, RESAMPLE_ZERO_FILL_SGIX.
	Replicate and zero fill are provided to
	give the application greatest performance and control over the
	filtering process.

	However, when pixel data is read back to the client and a
	packing downsampling mode other than PIXEL_SUBSAMPLE_RATE_4444_SGIX
	is specified, downsampling is
	performed via simple component decimation (point sampling). That is,
	only the RESAMPLE_DECIMATE_SGIX is valid.


Issues

	* this spec omits the packing downsampling mode.  But I think
	we will have to address it at some point, so I'm adding the
	RESAMPLE_DECIMATE_SGIX as another tag to complement the unpacking
	resample modes.

        * In the public Khronos spec files and headers, these values
          used to be used for some of the tokens: 

            #define GL_PACK_RESAMPLE_SGIX        0x842C 
            #define GL_UNPACK_RESAMPLE_SGIX      0x842D 
            #define GL_RESAMPLE_REPLICATE_SGIX   0x842E 
            #define GL_RESAMPLE_ZERO_FILL_SGIX   0x842F 
            #define GL_RESAMPLE_DECIMATE_SGIX    0x8430 
               
          These values corresponded to the internal SGI spec files and
          (probably) to what was shipped on SGI IRIX systems supporting this
          extension, but the spec was always inconsistent with these values.
          Since SGI is long out of the graphics business, in order to reduce
          incompatibility between tools pulling from the Khronos spec file
          and tools pulling from the extension spec, the spec file has been
          changed to match the extension.
