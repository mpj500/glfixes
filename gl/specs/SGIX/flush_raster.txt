Overview

    This extensions provides a way to ensure that all raster operations 
    currently in the pipeline will be completed before the next 
    raster operation begins. We define a raster operation as an operation
    that involves the rasterization stage of the OpenGL pipeline.
    The implementation is free to decide what consitutes flushing the
    raster subsystem.

    The motivation is to allow accurate instrumentation by 
    including this call before stopping rasterization measurements.
    There are cases where Finish() is used, but a FlushRaster()
    would suffice, so this extension is deliberately kept independent 
    of the instruments extension.
