Overview

    Mipmaps provide a general but expensive solution when the texture image
    is very large.  This extension defines clipmaps, which occupy a small
    subset of the memory required by equivalent mipmaps, but provide much
    of the mipmap rendering capabilities.  Clipmaps are especially useful
    for rendering terrain.

Issues

    *   Is lod clamping treated properly if we have no texel data?
    *   Should we always have to specify a virtual depth?
