Overview

    This extension adds scale, bias, and clamp to [0, 1] operations to the 
    texture pipeline.
    These operations are applied to the filtered result of a texture lookup,
    before that result is used in the texture environment equations and
    before the texture color lookup table of SGI_texture_color_table, 
    if that extension exists.
    These operations are distinct from the scale, bias, and clamp operations
    that appear in the SGI_color_table extension, which are used to
    define a color lookup table.

    Scale and bias operations on texels can be used to better utilize the
    color resolution of a particular texture internal format (see EXT_texture).

Issues

    *	still missing: GLX protocol, registry number

    * 	RE and IMPACT do not have hardware support for this extension.
