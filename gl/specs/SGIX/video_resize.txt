Overview

    This extension provides a means for doing swap or frame synchronous 
    resizing/panning of the area 
    that is to be magnified (or passed through) to the output
    video resolution.  The purpose of this functionality is to provide a
    means of allowing an application to draw into a smaller viewport to
    reduce the time spent doing pixel fill.  This reduced size viewport
    is then magnified up to the video output resolution using the 
    SGIX_video_resize extension.  This extension differs from SGIX_framezoom
    (number 57) in that it is post framebuffer resizing.  Over rendering
    at swap rates and panning at frame rates is possible using frame synchronous
    update instead of swap synchronous update used for the fill reduction case. 

Issues

    This extension currently only works on an InfiniteReality and later 
    high end machines.
