    OpenGL 1.2 is required.

Overview

    Certain graphics subsystems are capable of performing fast
    2D viewport or, in some cases, 3D volume "scissoring" operations
    within some coordinate range much faster that the host CPU could
    re-tesselate clipped primitives.

    This extension introduces the notion of an extended rasterizable view
    volume that is an expansion of the clip-space view volume.	This volume
    is the space within which a particular graphics system is much more
    efficient at rejecting fragments that lie outside the view volume than
    it is at performing strict view volume clipping.

    Clip-checking can be turned on or off through the glEnable/glDisable
    mechanism, and can be further controlled by using glHint.

Issues

    Should more precise control be given, instead of just a hint?

	NO. (Or not yet, anyway).
