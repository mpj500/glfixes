Overview

    The extensions defines a special purpose fast multisample clear.
    This clear can be used with some restrictions as a significantly
    faster alternative to Clear(DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT).
     
    The extension is based on the RealityEngine architecture and will
    probably never be supported by any other architecture.
