Overview

    This extension provides a method for OpenGL to read and store 
    images that are defined in standard YCRCB 422 and 444 video formats.
    As with the CYMK extension, conversion to RGBA takes place immediately 
    following the unpack pixel store, and preceding the pack pixel store 
    operations, and is only available on transfers to and from memory.  
    The algorithms that convert between YCRCB and RGBA are "black-box"
    in nature, and left undefined by the extension.

    Two new formats are added, YCRCB_422_SGIX and YCRCB_444_SGIX.

    To handle the difference in sampling rate for 422 video, the pixel 
    storage operations treat YCRCB_422_SGIX as a 2 component format,
    where the first component represents chroma, and the second luma.
    The chroma component alternates between Cb and Cr values on
    a per pixel basis.  If the specified image <width> parameter is not
    a multiple of 2, then fragments or texels that result from processing 
    the <width>th column of pixels will have undefined color value.
     
    YCRCB_444_SGIX is defined as a 3 component format representing 
    the Cb, Y, and Cr values per pixel.
 
    As with the CMYK extension, this extension doesn't preclude the 
    possiblity of other higher quality conversion methods.

Issues

    * What is standard packing for 444 YCRCB pixels?
      Does the 601 standard specify pixel alignment? 

    * YCRCB_420_SGIX and other formats?

    * should there be conversion quality hint?
