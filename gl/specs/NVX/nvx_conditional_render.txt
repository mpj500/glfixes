Dependencies

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 Specification.

    ARB_occlusion_query or OpenGL 1.5 is required.

    This extension interacts with NV_conditional_render.

Overview

    This extension provides support for conditional rendering based on the
    results of an occlusion query.  This mechanism allows an application to
    potentially reduce the latency between the completion of an occlusion
    query and the rendering commands depending on its result.  It additionally
    allows the decision of whether to render to be made without application
    intervention.

    This extension defines two new functions, BeginConditionalRenderNVX and
    EndConditionalRenderNVX, between which rendering commands may be discarded
    based on the results of an occlusion query.  If the specified occlusion
    query returns a non-zero value, rendering commands between these calls are
    executed.  If the occlusion query returns a value of zero, all rendering
    commands between the calls are discarded.

New Procedures and Functions

    void BeginConditionalRenderNVX(uint id);
    void EndConditionalRenderNVX(void);
