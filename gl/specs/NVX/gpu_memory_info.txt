Dependencies

    OpenGL 2.0 is required.
    The extension is written against the OpenGL 2.0 Specification.

Overview

    Most graphics systems offer a limited amount of onboard
    high-performance memory for storing textures, geometric
    primitives, and other data used for rendering.

    OpenGL implementations are expected to manage the residence of
    objects (that is, the memory pools in which objects are placed)
    automatically.  This is simple for applications to use, and the
    high level of abstraction allows many different underlying
    hardware implementations.  However performance sensitive 
    applications that are willing to adjust their usage of these memory 
    resources in order to maintain their desired performance are unable 
    to determine when the limited onboard memory resources are 
    approaching full utilization and swapping (with its related 
    performance impact) is imminent.

    GL_NVX_gpu_memory_info provides applications visibility into GPU 
    hardware memory utilization in order to allow the application to 
    effectively manage its resource allocations in the scope of the 
    current available GPU memory.  This information is made available 
    to the applications in the form of the total available resource 
    size (after initial system allocations) and the current available 
    resource (e.g. free memory) as well as a count of the number and
    total size of evictions of data from GPU memory since the last time
    this information was queried from this context using this extension.
