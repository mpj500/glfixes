Overview

    This extension provides interpolation coefficients just as they are required
    for GL_FILTER4_SGIS filtering in glTexFilterFuncSGIS.  The interpolation
    weights themselves are typically a set of equidistant samples along a
    smooth curve defined by several piecewise cubic polynomials, representing a
    two pixel wide span.  By reflecting these across the X axis, a four pixel
    wide span is produced, supporting 4x1 1D texture filtering.

    By calculating the cross product of coefficients in 2D or 3D, 4x4 and 4x4x4
    interpolation coefficients can be derived by other software, using this two
    pixel wide span of filter function.

    The coefficients are produced by one or another mathematical scheme.
    According to Mitchell-Netravali, many of the desired characteristics of
    other 4x1 interpolation schemes can be accomplished by setting B and C in
    their piecewise cubic formula.  Notably, the blurriness/sharpness of the
    resulting image can be adjusted with B and C. The reference is:
    Mitchell, Don. and Netravali, Arun, "Reconstruction Filters for Computer 
    Graphics", SIGGRAPH '88, p. 221-228.

    According to Lagrange interpolation, four piecewise cubic polynomials (two
    redundant ones) are used to produce coefficients resulting in images at a
    high sharpness level. The reference is: Dahlquist and Bjorck, 
    "Numerical Methods", Prentice-Hall, 1974, pp 284-285.

Issues

    What other types of 4x1 interpolation formulas should be supported, if any?

    Should TexFilterFuncSGIS be called for the user?

	- yes, TexFilterFuncSGIS should be called instead of having the user
	  do this. This is to be consistent with the rest of GLU, i.e., 
    	  mipmap utilities. Note that GLU was designed this way so that it
	  could be accelerated.
