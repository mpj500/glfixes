Overview

    The association of the current context with a drawable is extended to allow
    separate write and read drawables.  This paves the way for allowing
    preprocessing of image data in an "off screen" window which is then read
    into the visible window for final display.  Similarly it sets the
    frame-work for direct transfer of video to the GL, by treating the video
    as a special kind of read drawable (a.k.a, readable).
