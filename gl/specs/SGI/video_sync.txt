Overview

    This extension provides a means for synchronization with the video 
    frame rate of a monitor.  (In the case of an interlaced monitor, 
    this is typically the rate of displaying both the even and odd 
    fields of a frame.) The kernel maintains a video sync counter for 
    each physical hardware pipe in a system; the counter is incremented 
    upon the completion of the display of each full frame of video data. An
    OpenGL context always corresponds to a pipe.  When an OpenGL process
    has a current context, it can put itself to sleep until the counter of
    that pipe reaches a desired value.  The process can also query the
    value of the counter.

    The counter runs as long as the graphics subsystem is running; it is
    initialized via the /usr/gfx/gfxinit command.  However, a process can
    query or sleep on the counter only when a direct context is current.
    Each of the procedures described below will fail and return an error
    code if the current context is not a direct one.

    The counter is an unsigned 32-bit integer.

Issues

    Should glXWaitVideoSyncSGI return GLX_BAD_VALUE if <remainder> is
    greater than or equal to <divisor>? (No.)

New Procedures and Functions

    int glXGetVideoSyncSGI(uint *count);

    int glXWaitVideoSyncSGI(int divisor, 
			    int remainder, 
			    unsigned int *count);
