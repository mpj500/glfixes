IP Status

    There is significant IP associated with the S3TC format. In 1999 S3
    told the OpenGL ARB that they would not license it for general use
    in OpenGL. IHVs shipping this extension probably have executed
    licenses directly with S3 or its successors (Sonic Blue, S3
    Graphics).

    The current ownership of the S3TC IP is unknown to the ARB. It is
    known that when S3 exited the graphics hardware business, part of
    their operations were sold to ATI and part were spun off to a joint
    Taiwanese venture with Via Technologies, called S3 Graphics.

Status

    Shipping in several vendor drivers.
    Deprecated in favor of EXT_texture_compression_s3tc.
