Dependencies

    WGL_EXT_extensions_string is required.
    WGL_EXT_swap_control affects the definition of this extension

Overview

    This extension allows an application to obtain the percent of time
    used to draw a frame.  A floating-point value in the range [0,max]
    is returned which is calculated as follows:

                              td
                   percent = ----
                              tf

    where td is the time measured from the last buffer swap (or call to
    enable the statistic) to when the application issued a buffer swap,
    tf is the entire time for a frame which may be multiple screen
    refreshes depending on the swap interval as set by the
    WGL_swap_control extension.

    The value, percent, indicates the amount of time spent during the
    draw.  If the value is in the range [0,1], the buffer swap occurred
    within the time period required to maintain a constant frame rate.
    If the value is in the range (1,max], a constant frame rate was not
    achieved.  The value indicates the number of frames required to
    draw.

    There is also a mechanism to determine whether a frame swap was
    missed.
