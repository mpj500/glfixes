Dependencies

    WGL_EXT_extensions_string is required.
    WGL_EXT_swap_control affects this extension.

Overview

    This extension allows an application to synchronize color buffer swaps
    across multiple systems.  Applications that run simultaneously on
    multiple systems can use this extension to synchronize the buffer swap
    across each of these systems.

    The mechanism used to implement synchronization of multiple displays
    depends on an external sync signal.  This resource can only be used by a
    single application at a time.

    Each system running the application must have frame lock enabled in
    order for their system to participate in the frame lock.  If frame
    lock for a system is not enabled, that system will have no affect on
    other systems.

    For each of the systems to swap at the correct position, it is
    required that all of the systems genlock together.  Genlock is
    controlled through the Video Applet.

    The frame lock extension can also be used in conjunction with the swap
    control extension to control the swap rate.  The interval rate of the
    "master" system (i.e., the system at the start of the cabled systems)
    controls the swap rate.

    An implementation-dependent timeout is set when a swap is requested.
    If the timeout expires before all systems are ready to swap, the swap
    will occur.  The prevents a system hang if the cable becomes
    disconnected or an application hangs.
