Dependencies

    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.2.1 Specification
    although it should work on any previous OpenGL specification.

    The WGL_EXT_extensions_string extension is required.

Overview

    The image buffer extension provides an interface to allocate one
    or more memory buffers to be used for GL image functions.  These
    functions include DrawPixels, ReadPixels, TexImage*D, and
    TexSubImage*D.

    The advantage of an image buffer over normal allocated memory is
    as follows:

      o The image buffer may be allocated on the graphics adapter.

      o The image buffer may be locked once by the implementation thus
        avoiding a call to the OS to lock the memory down each use.

      o The data in the image buffer may be transferred to the adapter
        using non-snooping accesses.

      o Multiple events may be associated with the image buffer so that
        the data can be transferred asynchronously.

    Since the image buffer is created and maintained by a specific
    graphics driver, a DC is required to create the image buffer.
    However, the image buffer can be used with any RC created for the
    graphics driver associated with the DC.
